The fixed quantity of wealth fallacy is an old enemy of
libertarians. Almost all of us have denounced it in
conversation at various times, and literally hundreds of
us have denounced it in writing. I now add my attack
on this fallacy to the vast pile already in existence because this is not just any old fallacy; it is a fallacy of
epoch-making importance, which cannot be denounced
too often.

## THE MELODRAMAS OF MARXISM

The essence of the fixed quantity of wealth fallacy is
the claim that wealth cannot be created, only rearranged. Suppose you believe that. What follows?

You look at the world, and you see rich people getting
their hands on more and more wealth. They can’t have
added to the sum total of wealth, because wealth isn’t
like that. Wealth can’t be added to. Therefore these
rich people must have stolen their wealth from others.
The only question is: from whom?

Karl Marx supplied the first great answer to this question. The rich capitalists were getting richer by stealing from their workers, who were thus inevitably
getting poorer. (And eventually the workers, in a despairing fury, would rise up and destroy the capitalists.)

Marx greeted every tremor of economic difficulty in
the latter half of the nineteenth century as the beginning of the end for capitalism, and he fiddled the numbers to try to prove that despite all appearances the
workers were getting ever poorer, and that they would
accordingly oblige with a revolution.

By the beginning of the twentieth century the Marxist
melodrama had become impossible to believe in any
more. The poor people of the rich countries were, in
defiance of Marx, getting steadily less poor.

There *was* a Revolution, which meant that “Marxism”,
as interpreted by the successors of the now deceased
Marx himself, carried more weight than ever in the
world. But this Revolution had disobeyed Marx by
happening in one of the poorer countries, Russia, not
in the richest ones. What was going on? Why were
the poor in the rich countries getting less instead of
more poor, and hence less inclined to revolution?

The leader of the Russian Revolution, Lenin, supplied
the next great answer. The people of the rich countries
were all getting richer because the rich *countries* were
stealing wealth from the poor *countries*, from the
“Third World”. (And eventually, the Third World
would rise up in a despairing fury ...)

For as long as the world’s poorest countries all had the
good manners to remain poor, this revised, Marxist-Leninist scenario retained its plausibility. But by the second half of the twentieth century, a few of the formerly
poorest countries — most notably Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Singapore and South Korea — were also starting to get
rich. Were these Asian Tigers — apparently getting
rich by assembling such things as cheap radios — in
reality secretly looting the most distressed parts of subSaharan Africa, and was this the explanation of the
wealth of the Asian Tigers and of the disastrousness of
sub-Saharan Africa? Hardly.

The collapse of the credibility of the revised Marxist
melodrama coincided with the collapse of Marxism itself and of the regimes founded upon and justified by
it. All of humanity, it was now clear, was capable of
getting richer. That many people were still cruelly
poor no longer seemed like an inevitable fate. It was
typically made by Marxist or Marxist influenced countries.
After all, if you don’t believe that the process of
wealth creation is possible, you won’t worry about
wrecking it, will you? Although capitalism became
steadily less like the melodrama first proclaimed in the
Communist Manifesto, the countries presided over by
Marxists became uncannily like that melodrama. (And
eventually, in a despairing fury ...)

## ENVIRONMENTALISM

So is the fixed quantity of wealth fallacy now over and
done with? Alas, no. Humanity is now enduring the
next great answer to the same old question, about who
the nice but unlucky ones are, that the nasty but lucky
ones must now be stealing from.

Yes, goes this next great answer, people generally are
indeed getting ever richer. But, we are all stealing
from ... The Environment. Mother Nature. Mother
Earth. Gaia. (And eventually, in a despairing fury,
The Environment will rise up and ...)

Until such time as Mother Nature is also seen to be
thriving as never before — becoming ever more varied, abundant, ubiquitous and fecund — we are going
to have to share our civilisation with people wanting to
do the same old Marxist things to it, but for Environmentalist reasons. Many of these Environmentalists
used to be — or still are, on the quiet — Marxists, and
Environmentalism provides them with a new excuse
for what they have got used to wanting. Having abandoned the previous public justification of their efforts,
they can still redouble these same old efforts, in the
service of a new aim.

## POPULATION CONTROL

Fixed quantity of wealth believers are necessarily depressed about the future. Wealth is fixed, so the only
variable humanity can alter is the number of its mouths
to be fed. The “population explosion” must be curbed.
The more benign anti-populationists favour contraceptives and abortion, and threaten us with plagues and
wars. The more rabid anti-populationists *welcome*
plagues as Mother Nature’s alternative to wars, and the
nastiest anti-populationists of all actually welcome the
plagues *and* the wars.

Fixed quantity of wealth believers are even depressed
about the past. They deny the creativity of past civilisations, such as Europe in the nineteenth century,
which seem to have been very creative. Wealth, being
uncreatable, can only have been rearranged, from Africa or India to Europe, for example.

## DENYING THE CREATIVITY OF TECHNOLOGY

To the fixed quantity of wealth believers, technology is
like a conjuring trick. Oh sure, it may *look* as if a
rabbit is being “produced” out of the man’s hat, but the
rabbit was there all the time. All that the conjuror is
*really* doing is rearranging things. He isn’t *producing*
anything. All he’s doing is conning a lot of people into
thinking that he is.

## AN UNEXAMINED ASSUMPTION

Merely providing statistics which seem to prove that
wealth was indeed created in some parts of the world,
while simultaneously not stolen from other parts of the
world on anything like a sufficient scale doesn’t address the basic beliefs of the fixed quantity of wealth
fallacists. As far as they are concerned any new
wealth which *seems* to appear in one place *can only be accounted for* by it having been removed from some
other place. It is this actual conceptual fallacy itself
which must be attacked, not the bogus numbers which
its adherents are driven by it to invent.

The first answer to those who assume that wealth cannot be created is simply to say: *yes it can!*

The reason why this fully frontal method of debate is
so effective is that the fixed quantity of wealth fallacy
is not one of those ideas which typically gets explicated logically. People who think stupidly about capitalism don’t start by stating the fixed quantity of
wealth fallacy as one of their axioms. Rather, they
have jumped to their false conclusions about the world
and its alleged economic woes by assuming *without thinking about it* that wealth cannot be created. And
you can make them think about it, by simply telling
them: *wealth can be created*. Yes. It truly can.
Maybe that simple announcement will be enough to
sort out the mess of their thinking right there.

You can then lead them gently by the hand through all
those complicated and hideously unfamiliar notions,
like: Western Civilisation hasn’t totally wrecked the
planet. Poor people can get richer without rich people
getting poorer. Coloured people can get rich too, so
there’s no need to abort all those coloured babies. Life
is *not* an endless Hobbesian war of all against all, for a
static amount of the good things of life. Americans
can carry on eating too much junk food if they want
to, because they *didn’t* steal this food from India; they
grew it themselves. The rest of us can also grow what
we want, so *we* needn’t starve either. A whole new
world of creative achievements, past, present and future, opens up, once you accept that wealth is indeed
creatable, and that it has been, is being and will go on
being created, and on an ever vaster scale

## WEALTH CAN BE DESTROYED

Those who refuse to believe that wealth can be created, even when the proposition is shoved explicitly in
front of their noses, require slightly more subtle handling. Don’t go on about creation, if they can’t accept
it. Switch to the idea of *destruction*.

It is, course, fatuous to believe that wealth cannot be
destroyed, just as it is fatuous to believe that it cannot
be created. Both ideas are equally daft. But anti-capitalists,
unwilling to concede that capitalism could possibly create anything, are far readier to accept that it
might be destructive. After all, these people consider
capitalism to be tremendously nasty, and it really sticks
in their throats to say that it never does things like destroy people’s homes or food supplies. And once they
agree that something can be dismantled or smashed
apart or consumed into a state of uselessness, they’ll
be well on the way to conceding that other kinds of
effort might achieve the reverse of the above destructive process, putting things together, from a state of
uselessness into a state of usefulness. Conceding the
reality of destruction is a big step towards admitting
that creation might also be possible.

If, on the other hand, wealth *can* be destroyed, but
*can’t* be created, that would mean that the sum total of
the world’s wealth must inexorably be diminishing,
what with all the capitalism we’ve been having lately.
So how come even the rich white folks are still getting
three square meals a day? How could that possibly be
happening? And anyway, doesn’t *consuming* a meal
reduce the sum total of wealth in the world, to the tune
of one meal? Where’s it all coming from? Where the
wealth is coming from is: people are creating it.

I realise this must all sound very obvious to most of
my readers, but I am describing how to knock sense
into the heads of some extremely stupid people.

## CONFUSING A FIXED PATTERN WITH TOTAL IMMOBILITY

If the fixed quantity of wealth fallacy is indeed such a
fallacy, how come so many people fail to realise this?

Part of the answer is that people are confusing, on the
one hand, a state in which there is an approximate *balance* between the *rate* at which wealth is being created
and the *rate* at which wealth is being consumed or
being destroyed, and, on the other hand, a state in
which wealth is neither being created at all, nor consumed at all, nor destroyed at all.

It’s the same logical error as looking at the water coming out of a tap and disappearing down the hole in the
sink, and confusing the immobility of the shape that
the flow of water adopts as it rushes out the tap with
the idea that the water itself is not moving.

Lucky people, of whom there are now a great many in
the world, are by definition brought up in economic
circumstances not unlike that tap. All over the world
people are creating wealth, and watching it disappear
down the throats of their children and into the bank
accounts of housing loan companies. Nevertheless,
they manage to keep their household finances in approximate balance without too great a struggle. Their
pampered children then observe this balancing act, and
grow up thinking it to be a static fact of nature, like a
lake or a mountain. If such children get jobs where
someone — someone like the government — is supplying the necessary resources without any argument,
the illusion may persist, of natural balance unsustained
by any creative effort.

“Natural balance” sounds so nice. But if those who
grow up believing in balance then see it threatened,
while failing to appreciate the creativity that establishes and sustains such balances, they will become obsessed with the threat of catastrophe. Things, they will
feel, can only get worse; all balance will be “fragile”.
They will see disaster around every corner in the great
human journey.

People with more stressful, less spoilt childhoods, in
which the struggle of parents to make ends meet was
more obvious, grow up realising that such struggle has
always occurred, and that it often — although not inevitably (for wealth can be destroyed) — gets creative
results. They are thus more inclined towards economic
truth and economic optimism.

## BALANCE IMPOSED — AND THEN CONSIDERED A FACT OF NATURE

Having got used to living a life of “balance”, a lucky
person — or a spoilt and ignorant person, depending
on how you look at it — will tend to favour political
arrangements that perpetuate whatever “balance” he
has become used to. He will be a conservative. He
will favour laws forbidding the kinds of changes that
are liable to accompany new forms of creativity. He
will contrast the messiness and conflict that accompany the new ways of doing things that he so fears,
with what he imagines to have been the effortless, infinitely sustainable ease of things as they now are and
always should be.

If the “lucky” people win, and suppress all possible
futures in favour of their static, compulsory idyll, then
something easily mistaken for a fixed-quantity-of-wealth world will be created. The lucky people will
own whatever are considered the proper forms of capital and will permit income to be gained from this capital only by a legally limited range of methods. Unless
they recklessly squander their capital, they will be well
looked after. But all attempts to assemble capital of
new kinds, or to gain income from existing or newly
acquired capital in new ways, will be suppressed, by
laws which forbid technical innovation and taxes
which stop poor people from saving enough wealth
from their incomes to create new capital to invest in
new projects.

You see this sort of politically imposed balance just
about everywhere in the world that you look, but a
great deal more in some places than in others. Insofar
as “balance” prevails, people will see the world as a
fixed-quantity contest, because as far as they are concerned, it is. If agriculture is only allowed to be practiced in certain legally prescribed ways, then land is
indeed “limited”, in the sense that you can indeed only
get a certain fixed amount of wealth per year from a
certain fixed area of land. And if agriculture is all that
is allowed, that means that the only way to get rich is
to find some way of getting land from existing landowners, and become a landowner yourself. In such a
world, for the rich to get richer, the poor do indeed
have to get poorer, and if the poor are to get rich, the
rich will indeed have to get poor.

But the “lucky” people living in their balanced places
aren’t really so lucky, because in other places balance
is less favoured and creativity and innovation are
proceding far more rapidly. Life in these unbalanced
places is getting rapidly better, for just about everybody. Soon offers will be flooding in from foreign
places to the *unlucky* citizens of the balanced places
that these hitherto frustrated and embittered citizens
will be eager to accept and which their lords and masters will find it difficult to interrupt. So, yet again,
there’ll be a fixed-sum battle about what sort of place
the future is going to be. Insofar as one side wins, the
other side will inevitably lose. Once again, in some
eyes, the fixed quantity of wealth fallacy will be confirmed, even though it was precisely the greater ability
of wicked foreigners and vulgar local upstarts to create
wealth that caused all the trouble.

## CONFUSING THE TEMPORARILY LIMITED NUMBER OF COPPER ATOMS ON THE PLANET EARTH WITH A PERMANENT SHORTAGE OF WEALTH IN GENERAL

If you are determined to believe that wealth is fixed
and not creatable, you will be particularly keen to talk
about minerals, for there are indeed, for the time being,
only a certain number of copper atoms on this planet.
But wealth, to be wealth, has to be usable. Getting
copper in a very impure state from a mile beneath the
surface of the earth to the surface of the earth in a
much purer state is itself an act of wealth creation. So
is devising news ways to make electric wire which use
less copper and more of something cheaper. So is
finding cheaper ways to get copper from rubbish tips.
And, as a very wise economist has said, there are no
shortages, there are only prices. If you allow the price
system to function, then any interruptions to copper
supplies will cause the price of copper to go up, and
the search for more copper and for ways of making do
with less copper to intensify. End of problem.

The only serious worry is that, in an attempt to
preserve “balance” somewhere or other, usually in
their own back yard, fixed quantity of wealth fallacists
will freeze the price of this or that resource well below
its market level and cause the resource to be over-consumed and under-supplied, a shambles they will perpetuate by saying: look, we told you so, we *are* running
out of the stuff! That *caveat* aside, all prophecies
about the imminent disappearance of the earth’s scarce
resources are humbug and can be ignored.

The recent proof of this is that the price of the earth’s
allegedly scarce and disappearing resources — such as
oil and metals — has actually been going *down* in recent years, that is, *usable* supplies of them have been
becoming *more abundant*. When a fixed-quantity-of- wealth fallacist has finished complaining about how
capitalism is squandering the world’s resources, he is
liable then to say that capitalism is actually *less* keen
to get its hands on the natural resources of the still
poor countries than it ought to be. But the answer is
not for the price of copper to be fixed at an artificially
high level. That will merely cause a black market in
cheaper copper and an irrelevant effort to use less copper. If governments try to keep the price paid for copper to poor countries high by buying copper at a high
price and then selling it to the rest of us at a lower
price, that will cost fortunes, will unleash an irrelevant
search for more copper, and will result in a copper
mountain. The right answer is for the poor countries
which are now so dependent upon the price of a few
resources to diversify into other kinds of wealth creation and thus make their futures more secure, which
happily is exactly what they are now trying to do.

A further headache for poor countries with only copper
to sell, and for anyone wanting to believe that the
world’s copper supplies are about to disappear, is that
technologists may soon devise ways of turning other
sorts of atoms into copper atoms. Not that this would
greatly change things. The medieval version of alchemy many take a while to get established as a
serious business, but there already exist amazing new
alchemical industries which even now are turning dirt
into materials far more wondrous than mere copper.

Similar considerations apply to the even more daft idea
of an alleged shortage of *energy*. This too will only
run out if humanity decides to stop producing it.

## UNLIMITED PROGRESS IS POSSIBLE FOR HUMANITY AND FOR ITS ENVIRONMENT

Wealth *is* creatable. Human effort, in harness with the
human ingenuity that is embodied in technology, is
getting greater and greater results per head with every
passing year. Humanity has more than kept productive
pace with its expanding numbers, and if it continues to
think creatively, it will go on doing so.

As humanity grows, so will the environment in which
it lives. As we expand the domain of our creative endeavours, setting up space colonies, mining the asteroids, creating vast floating space palaces, and all the
while learning more of how the universe works, the
lesser organisms who are our natural companions will
expand their domains with us. We will take other
seeds to the stars besides our own. The latest fixed
quantity of wealth model of the world economy, of a
growing humanity and a shrinking human environment, in perfect combined “balance” with each other
and resulting in the inevitable destruction of humanity,
will then be proved wrong.

At which point yet more attacks on the fixed quantity
of wealth fallacy will have to be composed, to correct
new falsehoods built upon this ancient error.
