First publised 1984

Item: My friend, the LA Secretary Chris Tame wrote an article
about Privatising the Police. This appeared in the *Free Nation*
of June 1982, the newspaper of the “right wing” Freedom association, and Chris was hoping for a deluge of “yours disgusted
Cheltenham” letters, to enable him to keep the argument going.
Nothing. Not one.

Item: The “Tory Conference Report” (*Free Nation*, November
1983) notes that a Freedom Association meeting on “the need
for constitutional reform” was, although apparently not in a
very big room, “packed”. “We were surprised by the level of
informed interest in this last subject which we thought peculiar
to the Association. Conservative conferences now seem to be
drawing a pretty philosophical crowd.”

Item: The Freedom Association published a pamphlet of racist
quotations culled from the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich
Engels (£1.20 from the Alternative Bookshop — introduction
by Professor Antony Flew). The FA advertised it in *Contact*,
the journal of that left-wing citadel the Inner London Educational Authority.

Outrage! Letters poured in. How dare you advertise this
muck! The Freedom Association are monsters! Horror! Disgust! No concern was expressed about whether Marx and Engels *were* racists. It just isn’t the thing to say this. Not done.
Principle of the thing. Long letter from Professor Flew (which *Contact*, to their great credit, did print) rebutting the various
insults hurled at the leaflet, and contesting the assumption (for
that was all it was) that Marx and Engels were sound chaps
despite everything.

Item: I work in the Alternative Bookshop, which sells the literature of the free market and of the open society. We don’t
like being called “right wing”, but we inevitably are. Despite
that I have *never*, in all my time at the shop, been set upon by
any yours disgusted Cheltenhams, even though there’s plenty to
annoy them (“Youth Liberation” leaflets, LEGALISE HEROIN
badges, a prominently displayed leaflet on lowering the age of
sexual consent.) Could it be that yours disgusted Cheltenhams
no longer exist? On the other hand, I occasionally do talks on
libertarianism to Conservative gatherings, and can confirm that
this party is now rife with philosophical thoughtfulness.

Item: Two youths enter the Alternative Bookshop. They look
about them. One youth is silent, but the other emits loud barking noises, discernable as the two words: “Hayek!” and “Fascist!” Exit both youths.

It would take a whole book to communicate the stupendous
depths of wilful ignorance plumbed by these two animal cries.
If the youth making the noises had never heard of Hayek, then
his ignorance of Hayek’s theories would be excusable, yet he
clearly had heard of Hayek, and held strong views about him.

One of Hayek’s best known books, *The Road To Serfdom*, is an
attack on socialism. And what, according to Hayek, is socialism’s crime? *It leads to fascism*. Never mind whether Hayek’s
analysis is correct. The point is that were he really a fascist the
fact that socialism leads to fascism would not count in his eyes
as a crime. Good for socialism, he would have said, as many
real fascists did say.

In general, the use by leftists of the word “fascist” to describe
absolutely anyone who disagrees with them, including believers in the ideas of individualism and individual liberty
(which were and are constantly and explicitly denounced by
real fascists with extreme clarity and ferocity) reveals an amazing contempt for the English language, and for coherent
thought generally.

** WHO WAS COLONEL BLIMP?

Many years ago, according to legend, there lived a beast called
“Colonel Blimp”.

Before he died, what sort of person was Colonel Blimp? What
distinguished him from a mere Conservative? Not having met
any living examples of the species I can only describe the
memory of the him that has been handed down to me.
Colonel Blimp possessed the following qualities:

— Tremendous confidence in the correctness of his opinions.

— Tremendous hostility to intellectuals, and to thought in
general, that is, to explaining why his own opinions were correct and all others hopelessly wrong. You either understood, or
you didn’t.

— Species solidarity. Colonel Blimp knew a fellow member
of his species at once.

— The observation of consumer habits as a substitute for political thought. Although bursting with political opinions, about
bolshies, dagos, wogs and so forth, Colonel Blimp made no
sharp distinction between a person being a bolshy and a person
drinking the wrong sort of drink, wearing the wrong sort of
clothes, or travelling by an unsuitable form of transport.

If he met someone dressed like a bolshy, drinking a bolshy
drink, but *who opposed bolshevism*, Colonel Blimp would still
denounce the anti-bolshy in question as a bolshy, in a loud
voice.

On the other hand, someone driving an MG and wearing Colonel Blimp costume, but expressing *anti Colonel Blimp political views*,
is the worst sort of bolshy. “The fellow dresses like one
of us!” Colonel Blimp would shout.

The shouting is important. A Colonel Blimp who no longer
addresses bolshies with loudmouthed offensiveness, but instead
mutters something into his gin and tonic about how he doesn’t
“understand anything anymore” is no longer Colonel Blimp.
He is Colonel Blimp retired.

Now, run your eye down this list of Blimp qualities and note
that leftists more and more conform to the same kind of stereotype. Colonel Blimp is dead. Long live Comrade Blimp.

I’m not trying to be offensive just for the sake of it. Unlike
Colonel Blimp I am offering what I intend as a coherent observation. I’m trying to understand how things are. I have included evidence, and there is plenty of other evidence I can
imagine that might prove me wrong.

# WHAT FOLLOWS?

But suppose I’m right. Suppose that Colonel Blimp is alive
and well, but with a different title and in a different ecological,
niche. If so, the phenomenon of Colonel Blimp offers a
powerful insight into the future development and impact of his
lefty (bolshy!) successor.

Frankly, the Colonel Blimp story is cause for *extreme optimism*
to all who oppose him. Colonel Blimp became politically impotent, and then extinct, in an incredibly short space of time.
So too, I think, will Comrade Blimp. At the very least Comrade Blimp may soon be muttering about how socialism
“seemed like a good idea at the time” and whining apologetically that “we really did see some people as fascists”.

Why the suddenness of Blimp’s eclipse? It comes down to his
contempt for rational argument. If you say to someone that
he’s a sound chap, because of the school tie he’s wearing, or
because of his CND badge, you’ll encounter no disagreement.
Me, a fine fellow. But of course. Never mind the feebleness
of the argument. When did you last hear of an author complaining about a rave review, on the grounds that the reviewer
didn’t explain properly why he thought the book was stupendous?

If someone says you’re wrong about Chile because your figures
for the number of people killed by Pinochet are out, or because
Allende wasn’t so bad as you’re claiming, in short if someone
argues with you rationally, you are liable to be convinced. But
if he tells you you’re wrong about Chile *because you are wearing the wrong kind of tie*, you will absolutely not be convinced.
Quite the reverse. The argument that a “sound dresser is a
sound thinker” only convinces the sound dressers. Unsound
dressers are more than ever convinced that the sound dressers
are idiotic.

An extraordinary proportion of leftist rhetoric is now of this
peculiar stylistic kind. Reagan is wrong, because he was once
a cowboy film actor. Thatcher is wrong, because she wears her
hair blue. Young Conservatives are wrong because they wear
suits, talk in funny voices and play tennis. American soldiers
are wrong because they wear sun glasses. British soldiers are
wrong because they always comb their hair. NATO officials
are wrong because they travel in shiny black cars. This is fine
for convincing fellow readers of the *New Statesman*, and keeps
dozens of talented leftist graphic artists happily employed, but
it is quite hopeless for converting NATO officials or Young
Conservatives. In their heyday this is exactly what socialists
were able to do.

Just like Colonel Blimp, Comrade Blimp especially loathes
people who adopt some of his plumage without sharing his political prejudices, as we in the Alternative Bookshop have particular cause to know. A recent article in the *New Statesman*
by Duncan Campbell included an entire paragraph about how a
certain government phone-tapper had the dashed sauce to ride
about on a bicycle! This is not the way for Comrade Blimp to
recruit government phone-tappers to his cause.

Blimps make a tremendous amount of noise. That’s their nature. But when the Blimps have become too old to raise hell,
or have simply died off, what then? The truth stands starkly
revealed. For all their caterwauling, they were convincing only
each other, and merely antagonising everyone else. (The reputed Colonel Blimp sport of ducking homosexuals in fountains probably did more for the cause of bolshevism than the
entire Left Book Club’s output combined.). When Blimp dies
everyone heaves a sigh of relief.

# PROLETARIAN COMRADES

There’s a minor exception to this rule. Comrade Blimp, now
thirty five and rising, is convincing some proletarian thugs of
the truth of his opinions. This was Colonel Blimp’s one big
success as well. Remember those sturdy proletarian collaborators Bulldog Drummond always took with him on his adventures. It takes a proletarian thug to be impressed by Blimp’s
only slightly more educated thuggery, bombast and comic book
graphics. So we can expect noisy marches by East End leftist
dockers, by middle aged ex football hooligans and the like, for
a good many years yet, and the leftist equivalent of the National Front. Tiresome. But by about 2020 the Comrade
Blimp syndrome itself will be a thing of the past.

As the years go by and all Comrade Blimp’s caterwauling is
seen by him to achieve nothing, he begins to read the writing
on the wall. Comrade Blimp’s publications become ever more
doom laden, as the future slips from his grasp. Nuclear catastrophe and ecological disaster are brooded upon with pathological intensity. Is it fanciful to suggest that some of them
actually want the end of the world to be nigh, so that nobody
else can have any future either?

Insofar as there is now, still, any intellectual substance to socialism (and do not confuse being a professor at a university
with having intellectual substance) then socialism will continue
to be a problem. There is some, so it will. But there isn’t
much.

The other lesson to be learned is that although proving Comrade Blimp’s opinions wrong in interesting and unfamiliar ways
is well worth doing, as the Marx/Engels Race pamphlet does
for example, constantly repeating familiar anti Comrade Blimp
arguments is rather a waste of effort.

Any fool can list the people and institutions he is against, as
Comrade Blimp himself proves every day. But what of the alternative institutions Comrade Blimp’s opponents then create?
How will things be when these persons are quarrelling not with
Comrade Blimp, but with each other? That is the important
and interesting question.
