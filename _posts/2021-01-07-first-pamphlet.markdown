Work has begun on translating Brian's Libertarian Alliance pamphlets, which are PDF files, into web pages for this site.
The aim is to make them more easy to search and to display on a wider variety of devices.

The first one is [Economics Note No. 83 Linux! Reflections On Commerce, “Anti-Commerce” and the Owning of Ideas](/la/econn083.html).
