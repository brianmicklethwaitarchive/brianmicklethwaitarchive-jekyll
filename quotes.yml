  date: 1990
  text: "It is of the essence of the case for state control and state provision that The Facts about the world can be reduced to numbers whose moral or aesthetic significance is not a matter of controversy, and that by attending to these numbers boosting the good numbers and discouraging the bad numbers - state officials can set about improving things. And it is of the essence of the case against state control and state provision that this assumption is false."

  text: "Only strongly and consistently held opinions get media coverage, because only those who strongly mean what they are saying can spare all that time and trouble to assemble appropriate clutches of The Facts to decorate their opinions and get the media to pay attention."

  date: 1994
  text: "The end result of this pandemic of lawmaking and regulating is going to be the exact disaster that the sub-Marxists had said was already the case, a legal system which is nothing but an instrument of class warfare. The dominant class will be whichever class has captured the government, and the victims of the process will be whatever minorities that this governing class happens to have taken a dislike to. We will finally have a legal system that sends people to prison for, in the words of an old TV sketch, Looking At Me In A Funny Way."

  date: 1983
  text: "But suppose that The Arts really were “essential”. Suppose people really did shrivel up and die if forced to pass three entire days without once looking at an oil painting. This is no argument for government spending on oil paintings. Food really is rather important, but for that very reason the more completely the government keeps out of the food business the better for all concerned."

  date: 1992
  text: "These volumes, being mostly of American origin, and implying as they do that personal success is actually possible, for anyone, are scorned by most of the intelligensia, and by almost all of the British intelligensia. This is the intelligensia’s loss."

  text: "I believe that cutting the top rate of income tax from 40% to 0% would be a huge improvement to Britain, even in the total absence of any changes to the taxes paid by lower paid people, or to taxes collected by other means."

  date: 1996
  text: "If high earners do more, lower earners get pulled up the income ladder, to do jobs that the high earners are now too busy to do. The increased spending and investing of high earners creates more chances for the people below, and hence more spending by them as well."

  text: "I don’t know about you, but people richer than me getting even richer even faster than me only upsets me if I’m making no progress myself. If my life’s improving, I don’t care at all if the lives of richer people are improving even more. Good luck to them, and here’s hoping I eventually become someone like that myself."

  text: "...rich idlers may *not* be robbed by the otherwise respectable poor. Cross that line, and the next victims of robbery will be the poor themselves, respectable or disreputable. The property rights, not just of upstanding citizens with admirable jobs, fine reputations and unblemished credit ratings, but of *all*, must be respected."

  text: "That the goodness rule pays off for those who follow it, but only in the long run, explains why societies which suddenly *seem* about to collapse *do* collapse. In such a world, there is no long run to reward goodness and to punish badness."

  date: 1992
  text: "War, the ultimate collective crisis, shapes ideas with unique intensity. A society fights for its life, and the peacetime culture that emerges from the ordeal must operate within the philosophical framework that emerges from the fight. Peace is suffused with the “aftermyth” of war."

  date: 1992
  text: "Because of the way we fought the war, or thought that we had fought it, we installed in our minds a model of success which did work militarily, after a fashion, but which could not work economically, and which in due course did not work."

  link: /la/histn022.html
  date: 1992
  text: "The recent British “surge of enthusiasm” for the free market rather than state solutions to problems may not have resulted in much in the way of free market solutions. But think of all the nationalised “solutions” that have *not* been attempted, of the number of Royal Commissions *not* appointed, of mega-ministries *not* amalgamated, of the engineering companies *not* forcibly merged by the government, of prices and incomes controls *not* imposed.[^3] Ideas *do* matter, even if not in quite the way that the enthusiasts for them might desire."

  text: "Not for the first time in the history of human conflict, an overwhelmingly superior force delayed the obliteration of its far weaker enemy, on the grounds that this could as easily be done later rather than sooner, and that in the meantime there was some fun to be had."

  link: /la/lific001.html
  date: 1996
  text: "It was the kind of situation that causes left of centre economists to call for state intervention to solve the problem of the “prisoner’s dilemma”, the dilemma being that whoever makes the first move will be on his own, hoping for the cooperation of others but overwhelmingly liable not to get it. Public opinion in the MacDonald’s agreed unanimously with the economists."

  text: "The twentieth century’s leading personalities were by no means all of them the movie villains that they’re now presented as. Many of them were trying desperately to do good, and on a huge scale. Their problem was that their notions about how to do good did harm."

  text: "No matter how “extreme” is the opinion I may read in a pamphlet or magazine, I am never, so to speak, at its mercy. I can stop reading it at any moment, and so in the meantime I need not feel threatened or even discomforted by it."

  date: 1990
  text: "The world is full of people with wildly different views about the philosophical foundations of life, of the universe and of everything, yet on the whole they get along peacefully enough. Where there are major breaches of the peace, these are just as likely to be between peoples with near identical views on “the fundamentals” as between people without such philosophical affinities."
