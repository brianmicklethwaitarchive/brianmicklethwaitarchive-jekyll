We’ve all heard the cry. “Our ideas have not failed; they
were never tried!” But if you wish to use such a slogan it is
wise to state what your ideas are, and complain that they
aren’t being applied, before the failure (of whatever ideas
are being applied) has become obvious to all.

The advantage of such preemptive pessimism is that you
will later be able to present yourself as a prophet of doom
proved right, instead of merely as a rat leaving a sinking
ship.

The danger of preemptive pessimism is that you may
disown something that subsequently succeeds. The ship
may not sink. So be it.

## ECONOMIC FREEDOM

I do not know whether the Conservative government that
has just won the general election of June 9th 1983 will
“succeed” or not. I do know that if it gets beaten in the
general election of 1988 (or whenever) many things libertarians believe in will be thought to have failed.

Many people think that the present government really is
going to go flat out for “economic freedom”, and therefore
that if this government fails, “economic freedom” will have
failed with it. All those who now believe in economic freedom, such as all the members of the Libertarian Alliance,
will then have been “proved” wrong. Others think that
economic freedom already has been proved wrong.

Some libertarians insist that there is simply no affinity whatever between libertarianism and the Conservative Party.
Like me they are concerned that the Conservatives should
not discredit libertarianism. But these people are surely
being rather dishonest. Faint libertarian noises have been
emerging from the Conservative Party for some time now,
and the notion that effective libertarian propaganda can proceed merely by libertarians pretending otherwise is silly.

It is precisely because of the Conservative-libertarian connection that the differences between the policies favoured
by libertarians and the policies that the Conservatives are
now all too likely to rely on need to be so clearly spelled
out.

The issue that dominated the period from 1979 to 1983 was
inflation. Some say that the government’s success in this
matter was more luck than judgement, but success it
nevertheless was. Libertarians favour a free market in
currencies, with all the laws compelling traders to accept
pounds sterling in exchange for goods and services (the socalled “legal tender” laws) being scrapped. Inflation would
then become a question of taste. Those who, like me, prefer
to trade in a non-inflating currency would choose such a
currency. “Keynesians” could make other arrangements.
Nevertheless, given that the Conservatives are in this
particular business ardent not to say fanatical supporters of
nationalisation, they did at least run the business the way
they said they were going to. And whatever you may think
about the Falklands war (libertarians favour a free market in
defence services as in currencies) Thatcher did at least win
it. Libertarians can admire these things, just as others can
who would have done things differently.

Unemployment will dominate the coming period as inflation
did the last. If, come the next general election, unemployment is still very high and rising, then the Conservatives
will surely be well beaten.

## DO NOTHING

There are basically three plans for dealing with unemployment, the Labour one, what appears to be the present Conservative one, and the right one.

The Labour plan is to beg, borrow or steal huge amounts of
money from all who have it, including all those who now
run profitable businesses, and spray it over those least likely
to do anything useful with it. This is called “producing our
way out of recession”.

The Conservative plan is a negative one, namely to avoid,
so far as is politically possible, doing the above. Politics
being politics, there’ll have to be a few hundred million
quid thrown away on a motor car company here, another
few hundred million on a “youth opportunity” scheme there.
But aside from such diversions the basic plan will be to do
nothing, and simply hope for the best. God willing, the
“world recession” will end. The “new atmosphere of realism” and “improved productivity” now claimed to exist by
the more optimistic type of cabinet minister will bring down
unemployment, while the government sits and watches,
making the occasional encouraging speech.

But what if the world recession continues? Or gets worse?
What if all this new realism and improved productivity are
the results of, rather than the cure for, high unemployment?

In the aftermath of the Conservative victory a few allegedly
typical examples of the new Conservative intake were interviewed on television. In technical parlance they were all
impeccably lacking in “wetness”, that is, they opposed Labour “job creation” and favoured “real” jobs instead. But
when I was at school we used “wet” to mean anyone who
merely hoped for the best without doing anything active to
get it, and in this archetypal sense these new Conservatives
are wetness personified. They make poor old Michael Foot
look like Winston Churchill, for at least Foot wants to do
something about unemployment, however wrong-headed.
What were these mild mannered little political rodents going
to do to get all these “real” jobs they spoke of so yearningly? We must, one of them said, “pray” that unemployment will go down, that the world recession will end, that ...

Pray!!!!

There was no hint from these people that there might be
things that they could do about unemployment, things that
might actually work.

## REMOVING THE OBSTACLES TO EMPLOYMENT

Plan three for cutting unemployment is based on the recognition that unemployment is largely the creation of government, and could thus, by further government actions of a
different kind, be diminished and in due course virtually
wiped out.

A major step towards abolishing the practice of being unemployed would be to stop paying people to do it. Most
would consider this cure worse than the disease, but the
point should be made from time to time. Libertarians oppose the government taking money from people, however
much others may need it. Few libertarians would press for
this as the next item of government action, for there are too
many other government installed obstacles to employment,
the removal of which would cause no hardship. If paying
people to do nothing is temporarily excusable, there can be
no excuse for stealing money from the lowest paid of those
who do work. Libertarians oppose all taxation, and removing these particular taxes would undoubtedly cut unemployment. More people could afford to work. From time to
time articles appear in the newspapers about this particular
horror, for the problem is well understood. It even has its
own name: the poverty trap.

Cutting taxes means less government money to spend on
other projects, but abolishing minimum wage laws would
cost nothing. Where is the sense in forbidding certain deals
that those involved would otherwise like to make? A tiny
few on the borderline get slightly higher wages. But mostly
the result is that many rather undesirable employees, worth
only a small wage, don’t get offered any wages at all.
Charming.

Just as wicked are the so-called “employment protection”
laws, which also result in potential employers not offering
certain kinds of employment in the first place. People are
reluctant to hire workers they will later be unable to fire
without first convincing the government that such firing is
“fair”. Other regulations require job conditions to be safe,
which means that certain “unsafe” jobs may not be offered
at all. Why not let workers be the judge of safety? If they
think a certain job too unsafe they can get another, can’t
they? Perhaps they can’t. But if that’s so how will denying
them this job help? Job safety has steadily improved during
recent decades, but this has been because people could afford more of it, not because of the government.

## MORE RESTRICTIONS

The notorious rent acts, which have virtually wiped out the
free market in rented accomodation, are worth a pamphlet
on their own. Both the finding of work in places more than
a day’s journey away from home, and then the doing of it,
have become projects resembling military campaigns. Moving house, in the absence of temporary rented accomodation, is like moving to the other end of Europe. No wonder
thousands sit tight, on the dole, rather than face all that.

And so on and so on and so on. Two sides of A4 cannot
possibly accomodate all the laws in this country that forbid
people from doing harmless things, and which result in
them doing nothing at all. Yet at another point in the same
television program that showed those new wet/dry Conservatives it was revealed that of the eight new legislative tasks
the government is now engaged in, four consist of further
restrictions. There’s the new police powers act, a data “protection” act (which will strip away the protection from
data), something to stop naughty videos, and, a perennial
favorite, laws to smother trade unions in the same restrictions that everyone else suffers from.

In an amazing post-election article in the *Sunday Telegraph*
of June 12th, leading High Tory Peregrine Worsthorne
makes a virtue of the intellectual vacancy at the heart of the
present Conservative Party. He favours the ruins-with-Union-Jacks solution, and doesn’t even apologise. “Materially speaking there is very little that any Government can do
to give the unskilled unemployed a good life. Their standard of living is bound to be depressed.” But this “very
little” (which is actually a very great deal) is still worth
doing. Isn’t it?

There are quite a few Conservative MPs who understand
how foolish this mentality is. But too many either don’t
know about the benefits of freedom, or don’t care. Taking
the right action against unemployment would be just too exhausting. There are too many self-righteous fools to be outargued, too many books and pamphlets to be read that they
should have read ten years ago, too many dinner invitations
to be turned down. How much more relaxing to drench the
unemployed in Falklands spirit and forget the whole business. Many Conservatives favour rent acts, minimum wage
laws, taxes on low pay and so on, because like their political opponents they consider these things to be “compassionate” and “caring”, instead of utterly wicked.

Now that the Conservatives have such a large parliamentary
majority, some have predicted that factions within the Conservative Party will make a more public nuisance of themselves than is normal. Let’s hope so, and let’s hope that if
there is a faction favouring an effective attack on unemployment it will complain loudly when, as I fear, it fails to get
what it wants.
