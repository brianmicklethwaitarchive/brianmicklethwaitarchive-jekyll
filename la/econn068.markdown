In Britain now (now being March 1996) our incomes are taxed
by the government in the following way. The first £3,765 per
year that you earn, you keep it all. Whatever you earn between
£3,765 and £7,665, the government takes 20% of it (£780, according to my calculations). Whatever you earn between
£7,665 and £29,265, the government takes 24% (£5,184). And
whatever you earn above £29,265, the government takes 40%.
So if you now earn £100,000 per year, you now pay £780 plus
£5,184, plus 40% of £70,735 (= £28,294), which comes to
£34,258. All these numbers are based on you having no mortgage and not being married, and on there generally being no
complications. Also, me being the kind of tax expert I am,
they may be miscalculated and even somewhat wrong to start
with, or at least out of date. Nevertheless, the basic outlines of
our current income tax system are, I trust, reasonably clear.

The libertarian line on taxation is that it is theft (see Chris R.
Tame, *Taxation Is Theft*, Political Notes No. 44), and of course
I agree with that. None of these taxes should be levied. But
suppose we are involved in a discussion not about taxation as a
whole, but merely about the top rate of income tax, the bit that
swings into action as soon as your income rises above £29,265.
Suppose the only opinion being solicited is: what should that
percentage rate be? Now it’s 40%. What should it be?

My answer is: zero. That’s right. Nothing. Whatever you earn
above £29,265 should be *all yours*. The government should
take *none of it*. The top rate should cease being 40%; *it should
fall to 0%*. Anyone with an income of more than £29,265 —
*no matter how much more* — would pay just £780 plus £5,
equals £6,744 in income tax.

This plan needs to be distinguished sharply from merely *abolishing the top rate* of income tax, that is, taxing everything you
earn above £7,665 at 24%, with only the bit where the government switches from taking a mere 24% to taking 40% being
got rid of. Under this arrangement, an income of £100,
would be taxed at ,... er ... £22,940.40p.

If you like the idea of cutting the top rate of income tax to zero
(if only because of the sort of people who won’t like it), you’re
probably already thinking about the truly breathtaking incentive
effects it would trigger off (not least in yourself and your own
arrangements) and of the consequent fabulous improvements in
the lives of everyone (including and especially the very poor).
If you like heavy taxes on high incomes, you are probably already thinking about how very unjust you think such a change
would be, about how the government’s income would plummet
dreadfully, and how the poor would consequently starve in the
gutter in even greater numbers than now, and — even more
seriously — how someone like your despicable self would find
it harder to get a government job.

So what would be the results of this change?

*I believe that cutting the top rate of income tax from 40% to
0% would be a huge improvement to Britain, even in the total
absence of any changes to the taxes paid by lower paid people,
or to taxes collected by other means.*

## THE DETAILS OF BIG INCOMES WON’T MATTER!

First and most obviously, if you already make lots of money,
you’d now get to keep virtually all of it, and would be greatly
encouraged to try to make lots more, because you would keep
literally all of that. But it absolutely wouldn’t stop there.

The distinction between a system in which the size of your income is always of significance in determining your tax bill, and
one in which *the details of how much more than £29,265 you
earn don’t matter a damn*, is the vital one to grasp. If the *top
rate* was merely replaced by the rate below it, and all income
above £7,665 was taxed at 24%, then what you earned would
always matter very much — and the more you earned the more
it would matter. By contrast, a zero top rate would end a mass
of calculations and claims and counter-claims and deceptions
concerning the exact size of large incomes, both from those
making the incomes (claiming that they’re smaller), and from
the tax gatherers (arguing that they’re larger). It wouldn’t matter! If you’re more than £29,265 per year, you pay £6,744 in
income tax. End of story. All those silly bits of paper you now
have to keep to prove to the tax people that you earn only what
you say you earn in the way that you say you earn it, and
spend all that you say you spend in the way that you say you
spend it — that would all be forgotten about, and you could
concentrate entirely on making and spending ever more money.
Many who earned less than £29,265 a year would also pay
£6,744, because that would be so much easier and grander:
“There’s your £6,744 you vampires, now bugger off!”

Think of the number of tax advisers this change would sweep
out of tax advising and into more beneficial occupations!
Think of the extreme difficulty the tax officials would have explaining why their annual budget would still need to be increased, instead of slashed to far below its present level!

## HUGE INCENTIVE EFFECTS

But this delightful truth about the delights of having a big income is only the beginning of the story. If Britain were to
make the change I propose there would be a huge influx of
high-earning foreigners and returning tax exiles, and a far huger
influx of low- and middle-income Brits into the ranks of highincome Brits. The people now earning around £20,000 and
wondering if it’s worth working any harder (given that as soon
as they get above £29,265 they’ll be clobbered harder) will
suddenly stir themselves. Young men wondering if a life of
hard work would be worth the hard work would decide in far
greater numbers that it would. Some who are now paupers
would even decide to take a deep breath and try to climb to the
top rate bracket. The poverty trap would still be there, but
there would be a far greater incentive to climb out of it.

Many are scornful of “trickle-down” economics, including even
some libertarians. (See Danny Frederick, [*It’s Not “TrickleDown”: How Capitalism Benefits The Poor*](http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/econn/econn065.pdf), Economic Notes
No. 65.) But trickle-down effects are real enough, the only
problem recently being that there have not been enough of
them. If high earners do more, lower earners get pulled up the
income ladder, to do jobs that the high earners are now too
busy to do. The increased spending and investing of high
earners creates more chances for the people below, and hence
more spending by them as well. A top-rate-of-income-taxequals-zero regime would massively intensify all such effects,
making life hugely less hideous for low income earners.

## GOVERNMENT INCOME WOULD PROBABLY GO UP

... which brings me to the big snag of the idea: *it would almost
certainly mean not less money for the government to spend, but
more*. There would be a *huge* increase in the number of people
paying £6,744. Many others would try to reach the magic
£29,265 mark but would fail, thus earning much more than
they do now, and thus paying a lot more income tax than they
do now, and receiving a lot less in government hand-outs than
they do now. It is these £12,000-or-thereabouts a year low-tomiddling-earners who pay most of the income tax that the government now gets, not the top earners. Boosting the number of
middling-earners and encouraging all of them to try to get
above £29,265 per year would probably more than compensate
for the loss of income tax revenue from the relatively few top
earners who now pay a far greater amount per head. And since
more earning would mean more spending, the government
would also get a lot more from its taxes on spending. So the
government might — alas — be able to afford *more* people on
its payroll, rather than less. Even state bureaucrats would do
better. I suppose no idea is perfect.

## THE INJUSTICE OF EQUAL OUTCOMES — THE JUSTICE OF BETTER OUTCOMES

As for justice, rich people are not those who *earn* lots of
money, rich people are those who *have* lots of money. Denying
to those who work hard the extra rewards they are earning is
itself unjust. Inequality and injustice are two completely different and often opposite things. True, the change would also
apply to the savings income of the truly rich, the people who
have big incomes without working. But this would also hugely
encourage and reward saving, and hence investment. Such unfairness would be massively made up for by the huge benefits
that all would gain from the change, especially the poor.

I don’t know about you, but people richer than me getting even
richer even faster than me only upsets me if I’m making no
progress myself. If my life’s improving, I don’t care at all if
the lives of richer people are improving even more. Good luck
to them, and here’s hoping I eventually become someone like
that myself.

## THE BENEFITS TO ART, SCIENCE AND ACADEMIA

Given that I’ve space to mention just one more likely consequence of the lowering of the top rate of income tax to zero, I
choose to pick out the benign effect of the change upon the
more highbrow sorts of culture — scientific, artistic and academic. Science, art and academia all now suffer from the fact
that most of the big money for them comes from the government, which results in stultification and uniformity, in the perpetuation of error and of foolishness, in fact in all the characteristic ills of other nationalised industries. A better way, because a more competitive and diversified way, to fund high art,
high science and high scholarship would be for eccentric millionaires and billionaires — with all their different opinions
about what is true, useful, honourable and beautiful — to pay
for it, and not just the government. I take it we agree that my
proposed change would mean many more of such rich oddballs.

## WHY SAY IT?

I know. Is this idea “practical”? Well, if by practical you
mean that the members of the present cabinet will eagerly read
this pamphlet and exclaim “gee wizz we’d never thought of
that what a grand idea let’s do it now”, then of course it isn’t
practical at all. Worse, it probably isn’t what I myself would
do, if I had the power to decide such things. I only think that
lowering the top rate of income tax to zero and leaving all the
lower rates where they are is the answer if the question is only
about what the top rate of income tax should be. Yes, the top
rate should indeed be zero, but so should all the other rates, and
I’d probably start not by knocking the top rate down to zero,
but by replacing all the different rates with a single flat rate,
and then I’d try to squeeze that rate down to zero.

So if the top rate of income tax isn’t going to be lowered to
zero in the foreseeable future, and if I don’t even myself believe in the top rate of income tax being lowered to zero in the
exact way I describe, why say it? Just to be pleasingly outrageous? Of course that’s part of it. But I also say this because I believe it is useful to isolate the harm done by one
particular bit — the most popular bit — of income tax, not
only to those who must now pay it, but to everybody else. Explaining why the lower rates of income tax should be slashed is
easy, and it is regularly done. Poverty trap — unemployment
— injustice of poor people paying for services used more by
rich people than by poor people — poor people living next to
other poor people who pay no taxes and instead just lie around
all day watching TV. All of which is very true and can’t be
said too often. But I thought: let’s apply some libertarian extremity to the top end of the income tax scale. By mentally
slashing *only* the top rate of income tax to zero, even if doing it
only as the answer to an artificially restricted question, we realise things that we wouldn’t realise if we thought only of
lowering — or even abolishing — income tax in general.

Saying that the top rate of income tax should at once be
slashed to zero also has the pleasing effect of turning the proposal for a “flat rate” income tax of steadily decreasing severity
as the years go by into the middle-of-the-road mush that it is.
As we all know, middle-of-the-road mush is the kind of mush
that gets done.

## MAYBE IT IS PRACTICAL

But then again ... maybe life is more interesting than this. Another virtue of the idea of cutting the top rate of income tax to
zero is that it throws light on what are *already* the unofficial
not-for-public-consumption realities of tax policy. “Live and
work and invest here, and we’ll fiddle the numbers to make it
worth your while.” That’s *already* what governments are having to say to the highest-earning highest-contributing economic
players, footloose and fancy free, who can simply make half a
dozen phone calls and vanish to Malaysia next week if Britain
doesn’t offer a good tax deal on a three hundred grand salary or
a big investment. (For a good description of these new realities
— but for an absurdly pessimistic view of their consequences
for poor people — see Ian Angell, *The Information Revolution
and the Death of the Nation State*, Political Notes No. 114.)
So, if this is already what is being done in a muddled and secretive way, why not make it official? Maybe the idea of cutting the top rate of income taxt to zero is not only fun, and
illuminating, and pleasingly upsetting to those whom it is
pleasing to upset; maybe it is also what I *would* do if I could,
and what the people who decide such things will find themselves doing for real, far sooner than they now think.
