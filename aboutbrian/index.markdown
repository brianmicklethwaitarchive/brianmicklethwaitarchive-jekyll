# IEA event

On September 3rd 2021 the Institute of Economic Affairs hosted an event entitled _The Life of Brian: A Reception to Celebrate the Life of Brian Micklethwait_
in Brian's honour at their headquarters in Lord North Street, London.

At the event, formal speeches were given, which I have transcribed.

Following this, the microphone was passed around and many people spoke about Brian and his influence on their lives. I have begun to write some of these down
and am in the process of writing down the rest.

## Comments about the event

Chris Hartup, wife of Gerald Hartup, former Freedom Association, writes:

"Brian was amazing when he spoke at that meeting, cogent, not forgetting what he was in the middle of saying, and getting to say everything he wanted to, he considered himself one of the most fortunate people ever to manage his final weeks and he felt humbled by so many people turning up ...

At the meeting, he spoke about how truly touched and grateful he was by Syed’s involvement in organising the get together especially since he and Syed had a bit of a fractious relationship full of arguments mainly about religion in general and Syed's in particular."
