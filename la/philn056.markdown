First published 1999.

In Nigel Meek’s recent piece for the Libertarian Alliance
([The Inequalities of Arguments: The Differences Between
Normative, Positive, and Populist Justifications, Tactical
Notes No. 24, 1999](http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/tactn/tactn024.pdf)) he contrasts the “normative” natural
rights position with “positive” consequentialist arguments for
libertarianism: “because it’s right” with “because it works”,
“ought” with “is”. But there is an error here. Consequentialism is just as much a “normative” position as is the natural rights argument. True, consequentialist arguments
*include* “positive”, that is to say, factual claims about what
are or are not the consequences of libertarian or rival political arrangements. But they all also contain a “normative”
claim.

Rent control, for example, *does in fact* have the consequence
of drying up the supply of rented living space at a price
below that set by the rent controlling law. But why does this
matter? It matters because we *ought* not to restrict such supply. Very poor people will find it harder to get homes to live
in. They’ll either have to work even harder, to afford the
more expensive homes that are the only ones now allowed
by law, or hope for (even more) welfare or charity. And
that’s *wrong*. I am not going here to answer objections to
this argument. My point is merely that opposing rent control
is a moral — “normative” — claim, not merely a factual
one.

In general, we would surely all agree that intrinsic to the
idea of a “good” person is that such a person considers the
*consequences* of his actions to others (in terms of the harm
his actions might cause them), and also to himself if unrelenting altruism is not his style (in the form of the likely
punitive retaliations of others, the harm done to his reputation for goodness, and so on).

## NIGEL MEEK ISN’T THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD CONSEQUENTIALISM

Nigel Meek is one of a number of people who, as far as I
(wearing my Libertarian Alliance Editorial Director’s hat)
am concerned, can have the run of our publishing machine.
Whatever Nigel Meek submits to us of a libertarian persuasion, we publish. *Then* we decide what we think of it, and
put any objections we may have in writing.

As it happens, I think that publishing Tactical Notes No. 24
as originally written — and then this reply to it — is particularly useful, because I don’t believe Nigel Meek is the only
one who has ever thought like this. Nigel is no fool. (The
Libertarian Alliance does not bestow unheckled publishing
rights upon fools.) So why did he make this error? Presumably he had absorbed the uncontested assumption of the non-normative, non-moral nature of the consequentialist
approach from countless other arguments and writings, many
of them libertarian, which had also overlooked the same
point and contained the same confusion. Hence my eagerness to publish both his piece as written, and to publish this
response, for the benefit of all the other non-dolts who assume that consequentialism is only about facts.
This is a short piece partly because I feel unqualified to
write at greater length on philosophical matters, and partly
because what I am saying is fairly obvious. Few people explicitly disagree with what I am here saying. It’s just that
they sometimes overlook it. (When I did eventually assert to
Nigel Meek in a phone conversation the normativeness of
consequentialism, he at once saw the force of the point.)

## ALMOST ALL LIBERTARIANS ARE CONSEQUENTIALISTS

A further reason to note in writing the morality of consequentialism is that it isn’t only natural rights libertarians who
accuse consequentialist libertarians like me of being interested only in facts and indifferent to morals; many anti-libertarians aim this accusation at libertarianism as a whole. This
is because it isn’t only consequentialist libertarians like me
who talk consequences; natural rights libertarians generally
do it also. They mostly (as Meek points out) add on at the
end of their pronouncements concerning the intrinsic moral
rightness of natural rights that the *consequences* of respecting people’s natural rights are good, and that the dangers of
neglecting natural rights are harmful. Libertarians in
general, therefore, of whatever philosophical persuasion,
tend to talk about consequences a lot.

Since facts count for so much in consequentialist arguments,
it can sometimes seem that facts are all that are involved.
Libertarianism thus often seems dry and morally unengaged.
“We *ought*, as a matter of ethics, to get rid of rent control”
comes over merely as: “Rent control has, as a matter of
economic fact, certain consequences.” Most political debates are about what we *ought* to be doing, not merely about
matters of fact, and most people involved in such debates
know it. Persons engaged in such debates who sound as if
they don’t realise this can accordingly be extremely off-putting, because seeming not to talk ethically in a milieu that
ought to involve ethics suggests indifference to ethics, and
maybe even wickedness.

## MURDER MUST ALWAYS BE PUNISHED

Natural rights libertarians are entirely right to emphasise the
consequences of following and of not following rules, of
being or not being guided by principles. Rules and principles are extremely useful. They have good consequences.

The TV detective series *Columbo* — now way into its daytime repeats for oldies phase — is a relentlessly repetitious
monument to the principle that murder is murder and you
mustn’t do it, no matter how worthy a person you may be in
other respects, and no matter how worthless and deserving
of death your victim may have been. (I seem to remember
that Dostoyevsky wrote a book called *Crime and Punishment* along similar lines.) This week’s murderer whom Columbo is tormenting with his pseudo-bumbling interrogations
is in all other ways morally excellent. He’s a heroic doctor
whose hard won skills have saved thousands of lives, and he
is, naturally, immensely clever (almost but not quite clever
enough to outwit Columbo). His victim was a morally repugnant parasite, who didn’t deserve to live another minute.
This spiteful little person’s actions were jeopardising many
more good medical works in the future, risking many more
lives that the good doctor would save. So the doctor killed
him. Right? No. Not right at all. If we allow murder, by
*anyone*, of *anyone*, then the cat is out of the bag, the genie
out of the bottle. Let one “good” murderer off, and before
you know it, the graph for routine murders by routinely
wicked murderers of routinely good people will leap off the
top of the page. In the universal cry of the harassed teacher
in an unruly classroom: “What would happen if everyone
behaved like that?”

The point here, which we all understand — I’m not claiming
any special understanding of the world and its ways — is
that if you allow the *rule* to slip, if you allow the *principle*
to be compromised, then, setting aside all debate about the
intrinsic rightness of the rule, the *consequences* will be bad.

#### THE RIGHTS OF THE UNDERSERVING

The rule about murder is almost universally popular. Property rights can be much more contentious. Nevertheless, as
libertarians we insist upon them. A lucky son of a rich
father lives a life of idleness. Honest but poor persons far
better deserving of such good fortune are obliged by the law
not to rob the idle waster, even though in a better world
they’d be richer and he’d be poorer, and even though a taste
of poverty might be just what the waster needs to become a
better — even a happier — person. Nevertheless, rich idlers
may *not* be robbed by the otherwise respectable poor. Cross
that line, and the next victims of robbery will be the poor
themselves, respectable or disreputable. The property rights,
not just of upstanding citizens with admirable jobs, fine
reputations and unblemished credit ratings, but of *all*, must
be respected.

Even those mostly *very* unappealing persons who are themselves suspected, accused — *or even convicted* — of crimes
against the persons or properties of others must likewise
have their rights (in the case of convicted criminals, what
remain of their rights) respected.

## GOODNESS IS PERSONALLY ADVANTAGEOUS IN THE LONG RUN

“Rule utilitarianism”, as this attitude is sometimes called,
goes further, into the realm of personal conduct. I’ve lost
count of the number of times when I could have got away
with travelling on the London Underground without paying,
or of robbing a shop of some desirable item. Nevertheless I,
and you too if you are wise, will resist — will get into the
habit (follow the rule) of resisting — all such temptations.
You will almost certainly get away with this or that dishonesty, but make a habit of dishonesty and sooner or later the
law of averages will get you. Acquaintances will notice.
You may boast of your dishonesties to people who you
wrongly suppose not to disapprove of such behaviour. Or,
you’ll simply get caught, by some other rule utilitarian who
follows his own rigid rule about punishing all the shoplifters
and fraudsters he catches, regardless of time or expense, in
order to create the sort of reputation that *he* wants.

That the goodness rule pays off for those who follow it, but
only in the long run, explains why societies which suddenly *seem* about
to collapse *do* collapse. In such a world, there is
no long run to reward goodness and to punish badness.

## THE PRACTICAL USEFULNESS OF THE CONSENT PRINCIPLE

Another example of how philosophical rectitude — if that’s
what it is — and the practical workings of society mesh
nicely concerns the vexed matter of “victimless” crimes. A
favorite talk radio soundbite of mine asserts that the “consent principle” is both “philosphically appealing” (I usually
leave it at that) and sensible “in practice”, because crimes
where there are no victims running around yelling and phoning for the police are extremely hard for the police even to
find out about, let alone solve. Most crimes are only solved
because the victims (a) tell the police that they were committed, and (b) tell them who by. But if I buy “drugs” from
a drug dealer, who’s going to tell the police about that? Me?
The drug dealer? Only if we flaunt our dealings in public is
anyone else likely to complain. You can have entirely conventional views about the dangers of drug taking, and still be
strongly influenced by this argument.

## THE USEFULNESS OF BADLY JUSTIFIED PRINCIPLES

Good rules have good consequences, especially in the long
run. They can even have good consequences if they are believed in for philosophically absurd or theologically surrealistic reasons. If the God of you and your neighbours tells
you that you’ll be turned into goats and tortured in hell for
all eternity if you ever steal from each other, you may well
find yourself living in a much nicer community than the one
in the next valley, where they are more rationally atheist
about such things.

I believe that closet consequentialism is and has always been
extremely common. God may exist, but what exact rules
does he demand that we follow? Rights may be natural, but
which ones exactly? It is not now easy to answer such questions and it never has been. Civilisation consists partly of
the publicly agreed pretence that, because murder and
thievery must be punished if all hell is not to break loose,
murder and thievery are indeed “absolutely wrong”, because
God or Plato or The Great Hobgoblin, or Lieutenant Columbo or Fyodor Dostoyevsky, says so.
As a libertarian skeptic about the naturalness of “natural”
rights, I rejoice that Nigel Meek takes so seriously the kind
of rights which, for consequentialist reasons, I also think we
should all accord to each other.
