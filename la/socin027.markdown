First published 2000.

There are many reasons why people believe in — or don’t believe in — having a free, non-state-dominated society. In this
piece I offer the suggestion that there is a particular way in
which *climate* makes a difference. In cold places, I conjecture,
statism — especially welfare statism — is relatively easy to do,
and is accordingly done a lot and believed in a lot. In warmer
places, welfare statism is harder to do, and is accordingly done
less and believed in less.

## “WE FOLLOW ORDERS OR PEOPLE DIE”

Ask this of a country: Can you sleep out in the open all the
year round, winter after winter, or would sleeping out condemn
you to death this winter?

In Scandinavia, you *must* have a roof over you, every night, all
winter long. If you don’t, you die of cold. It’s that simple, or
such is my understanding of Scandinavian weather conditions.

In the West Indies, by contrast, you can sleep out all the year
round. Sleep out in the West Indies, and you *don’t* die of cold.
It’s *that* simple.

Readers who share my taste in movies may recognise the line:
“It’s that simple.” It’s from the Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson
military courtroom drama *A Few Good Men*. Says the Nicholson character, a Marine Colonel: “We follow orders or people
die. It’s that simple.” My argument concerning how easy it is
to do state welfare also concerns the degree to which disobedience might result in death. Scandinavian welfare recipients
must follow orders or die, but in the nice-all-the-year-round
West Indies, no such law of nature asserts itself.
I haven’t been to Scandinavia recently, and never during the
winter. Maybe you can dig a hole in the snow and survive for
months on end. I recently talked with someone who was born
and brought up in the West Indies, and she confirmed the basic
all-year-round outdoor survivability of its climate, at any rate of
her bit of it. But maybe the West Indies has freezing-cold-in
winter places as well as warmer ones. Maybe it isn’t that
simple.

But suppose that it is. Suppose that trying to survive the Scandinavian winter outdoors is suicide, but suppose that sleeping
outdoors through what passes for the West Indian winter is a
breeze.

## A FIXED ADDRESS

Looked at from the point of view of the welfare bureaucrat,
most of the “problems of welfare”, of the sort with which we
Brits are wearily familiar, are problems caused by him, the welfare bureaucrat, not being able to *control* the welfare recipient.
The welfare bureaucrat can’t *make* the welfare recipient do
what he wants him to do in exchange for welfare payments. He
can’t even know for sure what his name is, where he lives, who
with, what (if any) work he does, and what anyone pays him to
do it. It is much easier to lie to a government official if you
don’t live anywhere in particular. The government can’t so easily investigate your life, because it doesn’t know where you live
it.

The Scandinavian winter means that a Scandinavian can’t afford to take an “I’ll worry about that when it gets dark” attitude
to where he’ll sleep each night. You must have a solid deal
with someone that you can definitely stay somewhere, well before dark sets in. You must have a fixed address. Which means
that the government has you where it wants you, where it can
always find you and learn all about you.

A West Indian government, on the other hand, can never be
sure where its less respectable and settled citizens will be from
one night to the next. If a West Indian government shovels out
welfare payments to apparently deserving cases, these cases can
just grab the money and vanish. So, in the West Indies, welfare
recipients don’t need to supply true information or keep any of
their promises. They can just use whatever welfare money anyone is silly enough to give them to carry on wandering around,
begging and scrounging, robbing and trading. In the West Indies, I surmise, respectable citizens are far less approving of
welfare arrangements than are their equivalents in Scandinavia.

## A PALL OF GOVERNABILITY

In Scandinavia, everything is far better organised, because it
can be. The welfare recipient promises to spend the money he
gets in proper rather than improper ways, and does so. If he
promises to look for a solid, respectable job, he duly goes looking for such a job, and is very likely to find such a job. Once
he finds it he does it diligently. The job is solidly unionised,
the employers paternal and nice. (It’s far easier to be nice to
people who are completely at your mercy.)
In the above paragraph I put “he”, but only because “he or she”
every time would have been clumsy. Scandinavia is famously
full of mothers who are married to the state rather than to individual men.
But these are old-fashioned marriages, in which the wives love,
honour and obey their husband (the state), and in which the
husband is a genuinely quite good provider. The resulting
children are good citizens. When a Scandinavian government
spends money on education, education occurs. The pupils behave well, pay attention to their teachers and do their homework.

(In Britain, welfare mothers and the state have a less happy
marriage, their offspring tending to be more barbaric. The
lower depths of British state education are notoriously chaotic.)

The fact that in Scandinavia you *must* have a roof over your
head casts, I assert, a pall of governability over the whole of
Scandinavian society. The life of one of Ibsen’s Enemies of the
People is no life at all.

Scandinavian socialism and Scandinavian capitalism years ago
arrived at a contented and mutually profitable working relationship.[^1] In Scandinavia the rulers of Volvo and of Saab and the
rulers of the Welfare State have been hand in glove for decades.
Taxation in Scandinavia is vast in scale, but much of the money
goes straight back to Volvo, Saab and the rest of them, and the
more usual sort of welfare has long been tweaked to make sure
that people still worry about getting and keeping their Volvotype jobs. Scandinavian welfare is benignly inegalitarian.
Scandinavians can neither scrounge upward social mobility, nor
degrade themselves by trying. If they want to move up, they
must earn it.

(In Britain, where our winters are nasty but just about survivable in the open, we have a large but chaotic and demoralising
welfare state, which lurches between idiot generosity and idiot
cruelty. The British administrative class, who favour state welfare but yearn for it to work more smoothly, cast envious eyes
to the north.)

To a semi-West-Indian like me, Scandinavia is deeply boring.
But the truth (which many of my ideologically West Indian
comrades refuse to face) is that in its own boring way, Scandinavian welfarism works. It adapts from decade to decade, but
shows little sign of collapsing.

## VARYING SEXUAL MORES

Sex in Scandinavia is famously well organised, and is another
classic source of British administrative-class envy. The late
twentieth century post-contraception peace settlement between
adults and adolescents which is only now establishing itself in
Britain — have sex, but don’t have unwanted babies or horrid
diseases — has long been a regular feature of Scandinavian life.
Contrast the consensual healthiness of that with the anarchic,
exuberant, diseased sexuality that prevails among non-respectable West Indians. You can have sex out of doors in the West
Indies, all the year round. What the adults think about that
counts for nothing among West Indians who do not care to be
guided by adults. Climate helps to explain contrasting attitudes
to sexual freedom, as well as to other kinds of freedom.

## CLIMATE CHANGE — THE CASE OF SOUTHERN ENGLAND

If climate does influence enthusiasm for liberty, then what of
climate *change?* Might the extreme hostility felt towards global warming by collectivists be related to the fact that a warmer
world might also be a freer one? I’m now finishing this piece
over the Christmas of 2000. It was the amazing mildness of
London’s “winters” of 1999 and, so far, of 2000 — so mild as
to provoke inverted commas around the word “winters” — that
caused me first to sketch and then to finish this piece. I have
already alluded to the current “crisis of the welfare state”. Has
climate been part of that story, in places like the south of England? England endured its fiercest winter since World War II
in, I think, 1946/7, just when our modern welfare state was
being so confidently built, and our last really nasty winter was,
if I recall it rightly, in 1962/3. Tramps sleeping in the streets of
London were rare before 1962. Now they are an annual focus
of political breast-beating and Christmas-tide charity.

## A SMALL CONJECTURE — NOT A FULLY WORKED OUT THEORY

I am not here proposing a fully worked out theory, whose
wrongness, if proved, would cause me severe hurt. This is but
a small conjecture, and I see no purpose in taking up more than
the small handful of days I’ve spent so far in elaborating it until
I’ve learned more of what others think of it, and may already
have thought of it.

Someone should make a map of the world (*can* sleep out
through the winter — *can’t* sleep out through the winter) and
see what other parts of the world it makes sense of besides the
two bits I’ve picked on. Maybe someone already has. Who
else has said things about how the outdoor survivability of the
winter influences welfare statism, freedom and so on?[^2]
Do any of our quite numerous Scandinavian libertarian comrades have any response to offer? Is their weather really as I
have described it?

Have I confused “Scandinavia” with Sweden, and the “West Indies” with Jamaica?
I don’t think the Libertarian Alliance has any West Indian subscribers, but does any West Indian nevertheless have anything
to say about this matter?[^3] My understanding of, in particular,
Jamaica is that it indeed enjoys a most pleasant climate and that
it contains many extremely laid-back folks, but that it also contains many other persons of extreme, even pugnatious, respectability. Is this right? Does the weather seem to locals to have
anything to do with it?

There are other forces at work in the world besides climate, and
other parts of the world (Russia? The deserts of North Africa?)
to be considered. It’s no good not dying of cold if instead you
die of starvation or of thirst. Does the *extreme* cold of the Russian winter perhaps help to produce a collectivism so ingrained
that “freedom” is, for other than a few globetrotting aristocrats,
so silly an idea as to be unthinkable, and does the absence of
any big liberal tradition in Russia make Russian collectivism
uniquely irresistible, and hence uniquely destructive? (Even as
I ask, I can feel my simple conjecture being swallowed up by
the complexities of the real world, and by the obvious importance of other things besides climate.)
So, that’s my conjecture, and now I’ll move on to other conjectures. I’d rather move on, for example, to a closely related conjecture concerning how *geography* — rivers, coastlines, shapes
of coastlines, and so on (in other words the stuff that makes
Sweden so different from the other parts of Scandinavia) —
influences the freedom-lovingness or lack of it of different
places. Meanwhile, any responses to this conjecture would be
welcome.

[^1]: See John-Henri Holmberg, The Origins and Nature of the Scandinavian Welfare State, Historical Notes No. 17, Libertarian Alliance, 1991.

[^2]: Typically, historians and other commentators discuss the impact of climate in terms of the economy as a whole, rather than in terms of its impact on personal behaviour. Look in the index of a recent book much admired by economic liberals and libertarians, The Wealth and Poverty of Nations by David Landes, and you get, under “climate”: “arid, 13-14, 19-20; continental, 19; economic development and, 1415, 174; productivity and, 15-16; temperate vs. tropical, 4, 5-16, 68. “The emphasis is on the collective production of food, rather than on the individual experience of whatever is the minimum temperature.

[^3]: The Libertarian Alliance did recently (re)publish a piece (Tina Terry, How Gun Control “Wo r k e d” in Jamaica, Personal Perspectives No. 12, 2000) about the sudden and disastrous imposition of gun control in Jamaica in the early 1970s, but this was by an American lady who was merely living in Jamaica at the time.
