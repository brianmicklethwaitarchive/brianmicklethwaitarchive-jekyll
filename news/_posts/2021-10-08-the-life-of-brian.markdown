title: "The Life of Brian at the IEA"

A new section [about Brian](/aboutbrian/) is for material about Brian, rather than by him.

It starts with [speeches from the IEA event](/aboutbrian/iea_speeches.html) held in honour of Brian on September 3rd. The audio recording
of this event was distorted so I have done my best to transcribe the speeches.

After the speeches, the microphone was passed around and [many people spoke](/aboutbrian/iea_tributes.html) about how Brian had inspired them.
I am still working on transcribing more of these.

Additionally we are always looking for more tributes and reminiscences about Brian to publish here. Please contact
