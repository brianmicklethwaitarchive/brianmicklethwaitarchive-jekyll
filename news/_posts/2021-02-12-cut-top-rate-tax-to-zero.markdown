We will be slowly adding more pamphlets. Economic note number 68: [The Top Rate of Income Tax Should be Cut to Zero](/la/econn068.html) posits
the thought experiment of cutting the top rate of income tax to zero and describes the benefits to rich and poor people (and the state).

> I believe that cutting the top rate of income tax from 40% to 0% would be a huge improvement to Britain, even in the total absence of any changes to the taxes paid by lower paid people, or to taxes collected by other means.
