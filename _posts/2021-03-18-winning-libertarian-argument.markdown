title: "Winning the Libertarian Argument"

We are adding more pamphlets. [Tactical Note number 8](/la/tactn008.html) contains some of Brian's most
important and useful wisdom: how to spread libertarianism by arguing; not necessarily by winning arguments.

> When was the last time you *won* an argument, right there in front of you? When was the last time someone said to you: “By heavens! You’re right about this, and I’ve been wrong about it all of my life, until you took the trouble to straighten me out. How can I possibly thank you? Let me, as a pitifully small token of my infinite gratitude, kiss your shoes.”? Not recently, I would guess.

It covers the importance of politeness:

> The *right* way to be an extremist
is to say what you think and why, while absolutely *not* assuming that the person you are talking to has any sort of
obligation to think likewise, and if anything while making it
clear that you rather expect him not to. You think what you
think, and he thinks what he thinks. And if he hasn’t told
you already what he does think, then an obviously polite
next step would be to ask him to talk about that. The two of
you can then try to pin down more precisely how you disagree, assuming you do. It is possible to be an extremist
without deviating from good manners, and that is how.

...

> By merely proving that libertarianism and decency
can cohere in the same personality, you will be a walking
advertisement for the cause, as I might not be.

And it covers how to sell your ideas:

> First announce your product, and try to spin out
the conversation about it. You do this by finding out what
your audience wants, and you try to explain, if you can, why
your product will supply this. In the case of El Salvador,
find out what the man thinks is now wrong with El Salvador
and explain how your ideas might improve things, and why
his ideas might only be making things worse.

It offers the sort of wisdom that people on Twitter could do with hearing:

> No matter how “extreme” is the opinion I may read in a pamphlet or magazine, I am never, so to speak, at its mercy. I can stop reading it at any moment, and so in the meantime I need not feel threatened or even discomforted by it.

...

> The world is full of people with wildly different views about the philosophical foundations of life, of the universe and of everything, yet on the whole they get along peacefully enough. Where there are major breaches of the peace, these are just as likely to be between peoples with near identical views on “the fundamentals” as between people without such philosophical affinities.

And there are descriptions of the ways in which people change their minds.

> The notion that one can
“convince” somebody of the truth of libertarianism with one
mere “argument” is rooted in a false model of how people
think about political matters. Political thought is rooted not
merely in “facts” but in contrasting “world views” or
“models” of how the world is and how it ought to be improved.

...

> For
some anti-libertarians it comes as a shattering revelation to
learn that there actually are real live libertarians, and that we
mean what we say. Until then they had assumed that people
only believed in capitalism for the sake of their dividends.
The mere *existence* of a sincere libertarian might for such a
person be the decisive, conversion-inducing “fact”.
