Brian sadly passed away on October 15th, 2021.

He will be missed. Many, many people are grateful for his lifetime of dedication to liberty.

He wanted his work to be preserved and shared. I and others are working on making sure that happens, through this site and by keeping all of his posts and photos and podcasts online.

He wanted to hear what people thought of him, and gladly this was possible at the wonderful [event held in his honour](/aboutbrian/) at the IEA. I have transcribed much of what was said at this
event, and that work is ongoing.
