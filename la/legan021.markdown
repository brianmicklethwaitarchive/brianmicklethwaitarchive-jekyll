Brian Micklethwait

First published 1994

A few years back I wrote a diatribe in favour of footnotes and of the idea that when footnotes were required, for Libertarian Alliance pamphlets or for
anything else, those who failed to supply them should
be consigned to the flames of hell. I’m afraid this little
pamphlet has no footnotes either, because a central part
of my argument is that although my subject is collosally important, neither I nor most other people really
know about it any more. I refer to that vague yet crucial concept, the rule of law.

## SUB-MARXISM VERSUS THE MICKLETHWAIT FAMILY

In the early seventies I was a sociology student, and I
recall well the general political and intellectual atmosphere of those times, which has been well described as
“sub-Marxist”. The actual reading of Marx, right
through, or of anything else right through, was going
out of style. The era was dominated not so much by
Marx himself as by slogans or rubrics or lines of subintellectual chat derived at third hand from Marx, suitably revised by persons like Herbert Marcuse to account for the mysterious failure of the working class to
trade in its Vauxhall Vivas for a revolution.
One of the lines of chat concerned the “rule of law”,
always placed between derisive inverted commas. The
rule of law, went the sub-Marxist, New Left patter, was
a bourgeois sham, a fraud, a mask behind which the
ruling class procedes with its class warfare.

I had a interesting slant on this rule of law stuff because my late father was a quite grand lawyer, a QC
(for the benefit of non-Brits, this stands for Queen’s
Council and means a superior sort of trial lawyer) and
he then became something called (this may impress
other British lawyers) the Commissioner for National
Insurance and Industrial Injuries, a job on a par with
being a judge, and which got him a knighthood. My
father’s father was also a QC and a Sir, as was my
mother’s father. So I think you can see that the law
and what happens in law courts is a big deal in my
family, and even if neither I nor my three siblings have
gone on to study law in detail by becoming lawyers or
law academics, we still greatly respect the idea of and
the fact of law and have an ingrained understanding of
it.

Taunting my father with the sub-Marxist sociology student line on law and lawyers, I was faced with the extremely firm assertion that on the contrary, the rule of
law is most definitely *not* a sham. It matters very
much what the law says and what lawyers do in their
courts, and it is absolutely *not* the case that the law is
merely a disguised way for the ruling class to bash the
workers, for the nobs to take it out on the yobs. Class
warfare, like any other kind of warfare, takes little account of individuals or of individual blame, but law
courts are *all about* individuals and individual blame.
Exactly which individual did exactly what, and what
ought individually to be done to that individual? This
is the agenda of law courts. A nob, if found guilty,
gets punished. A yob, if not found guilty, is set free.
Nobs, in general, versus yobs, in general, it *absolutely
is not*.

Was my father, a nob if ever there was one, right?
After much thought I decided that he *was* right. In this
matter at least I am his true son. But I was enough of
a sociology student not to bother with the details of the
law, and so it has remained. I have inherited an intuitive grasp of how the law works and why it matters,
and have studied something of how it developed historically, but ploughing through things like the latest
Criminal Justice Act is not my idea of fun at all.

## THE CHATTERERS WHO DIDN’T CHATTER

But at least I am in favour of law, and have a rough
grasp of how important it is. Contrast this with the
prevailing attitude of my politically active contemporaries, who have all my idleness on legal matters, without the corrective of my family background.

It’s very odd, if you think about it. We have had a
generation of “radicals” so completely denied the educational benefits of police brutality and government
nastiness that they have spent the last two decades saying that the rule of law *doesn’t matter*. A century earlier, the intellectual and — no doubt in lots of cases
literal — ancestors of these same nineteen sixties and
seventies “radicals” were *obsessed* with law, and with
the correctness or incorrectness of this or that government decision, this or that legal procedure. Lots of
them *were* lawyers. They made parliamentary
speeches, and wrote books, pamphlets and national
constitutions saturated with such notions, and they
watched the actual political bosses of their time for infractions against these beloved principles of legality
like hawks. In the nineteen sixties and seventies, their
descendants drivelled on about the repressive atmosphere created by “late” capitalism and its overproduction of washing machines, and ignored the mere law
completely, except insofar as it pertained to marijuana
or demonstrating.

I include myself in this general criticism. For me, one
of the pleasures of libertarianism has been that one
need not worry about what the nationalised industry of
state law consists of. Come the libertarian nirvana,
there would be a free market in law and all will be
well, and the details didn’t matter. Meanwhile, that
pessimistic and legally educated limited statist, Sean
Gabb, who edits the Libertarian Alliance’s journal *Free
Life*, has been grubbing about in law libraries for the
last decade, sounding the alarm about the ever sorrier
state of the rule of law in Britain. But only very recently have I started to pay serious attention to such
warnings. I too have stuck with such things as marijuana.

Not having paid attention carefully to this debate
(that’s my whole point here!) I don’t *know* what’s been
going on in the academic field of legal philosophy, but
I *suspect* it of having been a horror story, a genteel
British version of the *fuhrerprinzip*, explicated by such
respected luminaries as Ronald Dworkin and H. L. A.
Hart. I sense that a generation of “radical” lawyers is
now coming on stream, with considerably less understanding even than I of what “law” really means, and
is now busily wrecking the same legal system that it
ought to be defending vigorously. These ignoramuses
and monsters are now, I fear, starting to become judges
and to do real harm. After all, if our existing legal
system is but a mask for class warfare, destroying it
can’t make things any worse, can it?

## “WHY DIDN’T YOU STOP ME?”

So, you ask, what? So, number one, it is not surprising that a torrent of laws are now being passed, many
of which the chattering classes sense to be deeply
scary, but which they are in no way intellectually prepared to contest, yard by yard, this bit but not that bit,
and *that bit especially*. Joe Public, egged on by the
tabloid press, wants the teenage underclass either to
bloody well start behaving or else be chased, caught,
convicted, locked up with the key thrown away, and if
the legal barriers erected in the course of the last seven
centuries are kicked over in the chase, tough. The
chattering classes look on, mute, unable even to chatter
about the harm that is being done. They simply
haven’t done any serious thinking on this topic, and all
the thinking they have done is rotten to the core.
Joe Public is also passionately in favour of being more
tightly regulated, i.e. everyone else being more tightly
regulated. A minivan crashes on a motorway, killing
half a dozen kids, and Joe Public — through his faithful tribune the tabloid press — demands yet more laws
against whatever it is, demanding, I don’t know, compulsory seatbelts in the back seats of minivans. The
real moral of a tragedy like this is that Joe Public, the
driver of the minivan, is an irresponsible idiot for
falling asleep at the wheel. But Joe Public prefers to
blame his government for his sins instead of himself,
in the manner of a child yelling at its parents: “Why
didn’t you stop me?”

Well, why *didn’t* the government stop the tragedy?
And if it didn’t, is not that same government the murderer of six defenceless children? And should it not
rectify this state of affairs *at once* by passing a comprehensive law against this particular irresponsibility
and two dozen other related irresponsibilities besides,
while we’re about it?

The situation is not made any easier for anyone opposing such new laws if, as they always try to do, the
television or newspaper people manage to find some of
the bereaved and get them to ask such questions.

The chattering classes are, as I say, struck dumb. Or
worse, they too may want some more hastily penned
laws. The arguments against legislation mania, one of
the more important of them being that having more
than a certain large number of laws is the exact functional equivalent of having no laws at all, just haven’t
been examined in the chatter of the chattering classes
for the last few years. So, compulsory seat belts in the
backs of minivans it is, and ... oh, what the hell ... let
the relevant junior cabinet minister, that nice Mr
What’s-his-name, who always dresses so smartly and
has such an agreeable television manner, decide the details of the law and have them printed out as and when
he feels inclined, along with all the other laws being
decided by his ministerial friends and rivals or their
civil servants on that particular day.

## WE ARE ALL GUILTY NOW

The end result of this pandemic of lawmaking and
regulating is going to be the exact disaster that the sub-Marxists had said was already the case, a legal system
which is nothing but an instrument of class warfare.
The dominant class will be whichever class has captured the government, and the victims of the process
will be whatever minorities that this governing class
happens to have taken a dislike to. We will finally
have a legal system that sends people to prison for, in
the words of an old TV sketch, Looking At Me In A
Funny Way.

How come? Am I saying that innocent people will be
stitched up and clapped in jail? Not a bit of it. Only
the guilty will be convicted. Only the guilty will have
their lives ruined. But pile up enough laws about pornography, health and hygiene, maximum working
hours, back seat seatbelts, pet supervision, decibel levels at parties, doing your VAT in time, growing
oranges without a license, *etcetera etcetera et* bloody
*cetera*. Stir in a few innocent looking generalisations
like: the government can decide at will to stop prosecuting you if it decides it likes you again. And the
government is then unstoppable. If you then Look At
Them In A Funny Way, they can imprison you for ever
for possessing one dog-eared copy of the *Karma Sutra*
or for feeding your children more than the maximum
daily permitted dose of chocolate biscuits, or for whatever other infraction of the law they chance upon you
having infringed. On the other hand, if, once all this
has been explained to you, you change your attitude
and decide to become one of their stoolies —or whatever it is they want — then all charges can be magically dropped.

To quote another piece of sub-Marxist claptrap of an
earlier time which is also now coming true: We Are All
Guilty. Once again, if you say that everyone already is
guilty, the way those damned sixties “radicals” did say,
then how can it make things any worse if you decide
that actually everyone really is guilty? Where’s the big
change?

I recall reading in (I think) the American libertarian
magazine *Reason*, that in one of the states of the
United States they have two laws, one saying that a
certain sort of night garment is compulsory for some
damn reason or another, and a different law in another
part of the legal forest entirely which says that this
same sort of night garment is illegal, for reasons of fire
hazard. Perfect. A policeman can arrest absolutely
anyone, confident that one or other of these laws at
least is being broken, even if nothing else is. Tyrannical state officials don’t have to go out of their way to
create such paired laws as these, guaranteed to entrap
anyone they want to entrap, given the present state of
public opinion or the present habits of our lawmakers.
They can just let the laws pile up and then match them
together, the way you sort your socks out after a trip to
the laundrette.

*Et voilà*: there you have it. *The Full Coercive Apparatus Of A Police State* (see Sean Gabb, Libertarian
Alliance Legal Notes Number 6, 1989, titled thus, and
subtitled *Thoughts On The Dark Side Of The Thatcher
Decade*), followed by class warfare, democratised or
not, to see which class controls this omnipotent machine for destroying anyone that any well placed individual or group of individuals aims it at.

## THERE IS STILL TIME AND WE MUST USE IT

Micklethwait’s law of nationalised industries states that
nationalised industries don’t go to hell immediately.
They do little harm to begin with, and may even do
some immediate good. In this case, smashing away
the rights of the accused and regulating against this
and that may indeed start by reducing the number of
old-fashioned type crimes and the number of children
slaughtered on the motorways or harmed by excessive
chocolate biscuit consumption. But *then*, slowly but
surely, and with increasingly destructive consequences,
nationalised industries *do* go to hell. It will be several
decades before the writing of something like this
pamphlet, for example, could be so dangerous as to
amount to an exercise in self-destruction, but that is
the way things are now heading.

Accordingly, we chatterers have time, but must use it.
We must denounce this explosion of regulation and
ministerial discretion and arbitrary power, in writing
and in detail.

The libertarians amongst us must cease being concerned only about stamping on the grave of Karl Marx
and worrying only about the mere *level* of taxation (as
if the scale of the government’s activities is the only
thing that matters, and as if the *nature* of those activities is of no importance).

And all you ex-sub-Marxists still have time to correct
the intellectual ommissions and errors of your wasted
and hideously prolonged adolescences. You can still
redeem your now ebbing lives by ceasing to moan
about Thatcherism as if absolutely all of it was bad, by
instead describing those bits of it that really are bad, in
the Sean Gabb manner. Freedom good; tyranny bad.
You agree with that, don’t you? Well it’s about time
you did. If you are prepared to sully yourselves by
submitting to the Libertarian Alliance good pieces of
writing that defend legality and virtue and decency and
the right to smoke dope and wave banners, but without
any simultaneous demands that stockbrokers be forbidden to broke stocks or car salesmen to sell cars, then
the Libertarian Alliance is willing to sully itself by
publishing such stuff. Your writings will then be
mailed out to the universe, alongside other writings
about the wonders of unrestrained capitalism and the
glories of the Global Information Superhighway.

## WRITE IT DOWN

I am the Libertarian Alliance’s Editorial Director. I do
the Libertarian Alliance’s desktop publishing. I am
starting to do A3 colour posters, featuring quotes from
earlier Libertarian Alliance publications together with
eye-catching graphics, for undergraduates — and humans — to put on their walls. I don’t just have the
right to indulge in generalised ranting; it is my duty.
The real writers, the ones who write down exactly
which issue of *Reason* it was in which they saw that
bit about the nightdress laws and exactly what the law
said, and who do their footnotes properly, need to
know what sort of longer-winded publications the
Libertarian Alliance wishes them to produce and can
be relied upon to publish and make much of.

A politics student called Malcolm Hutty gave a most
interesting and depressing talk about the growth of
British discretionary state power and consequent decline in the lawfulness of the British legal system, at
my last-Friday-of-the-month libertarian gathering a few
weeks back as I write this, on September 30th 1994. I
urged him then to write down as best he could, even
without proper footnotes if that was the price to be
paid, approximately what he said that night. I urged
him again to write it down when subsequently thanking him for his talk, and I now urge him yet again.
Write it down, Malcolm. (It was this talk which first
alerted me to the full significance of the fact that the
government can now *stop* a prosecution, even a prosecution originated by a private citizen, whenever it
feels like it.)

Those of us who favour that free market in law that I
mentioned at the beginning of this piece should oblige
with a bit of detail. I should do this. I should say
what else is meant by the rule of law besides having
about the right number of laws. I hope to be producing something like this Real Soon Now, as they say in
the computer software business.

## CONSERVATIVES HAVE THEIR USES

There is at least one noble exception that ought to be
made concerning the dereliction of duty perpetrated by
Britain’s chatterers on the subject of law. I refer to the
conservative chatterer Christopher Booker, who now
writes about the menace of rampant regulation for the
*Sunday Telegraph*, and who recently also contributed
an article on this topic to the recent issue of *Economic
Affairs*, the journal of the Institute of Economic Affairs
that was entirely devoted to this crucial topic (Volume
14, No. 4, June 1994).

As a libertarian I have no automatic love for conservatives, for real conservatives that is, who love the past
and fear for the future. (I don’t mean “conservatives”
who are in the mere Conservative Party because they
like capitalism or attending coffee mornings or something.) But those conservatives — Sean Gabb is another, of course — who have been concerned about
conserving the effectiveness and honesty of the British
legal system deserve our respect.

Conservatives are no use at telling us what positively
to believe in. They are no good at mapping and creating the future, and communicating enthusiasm and optimism about it. All you get from them about the
future is clouds of vacuous abstractions, and a general
atmosphere to the effect that the battle is already lost
anyway, what’s the use, everyone under thirty is incurably barbaric, the future will be hell and to hell with it.
But when an actual specific institution or network of
institutions is being destroyed but while the memory of
it still lingers, conservatives can be useful people.
They can describe the lost Eden in reverent detail, and
the nature of the snake or snakes in the Garden, better
than your average optimistic radical — such as I —
ever can. Conservatives are always looking for the
evidence that things are getting worse and worse, and
where things really are getting worse and worse, they
are temperamentally inclined to do the exact job that
needs doing. I can’t believe that Booker is the only
conservative who has been talking sense about the
ghastly realities of British lawmaking and regulation
mongering in recent years; far more likely is that he is
simply the only one I happen to have heard of. I hope
that this piece of writing will cause me to learn of
other such conservatives, including many who have yet
to be published and who would relish the thought of
penning future issues of Legal Notes.
