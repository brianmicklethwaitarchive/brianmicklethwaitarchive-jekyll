First published 1990

The first rule for winning the libertarian argument is that you
must have it.

That sounds fairly obvious, does it not? Yet how many times
must we libertarians listen to self-styled “practical” and “realistic” comrades, who tell us that the way to argue for the
abolition of income tax or the legalisation of heroin or the
abolition of compulsory education is to start these arguments
by arguing instead for the lowering of income tax by two per
cent, the legalisation of marijuana, and the introduction of
education vouchers. The idea is that having bought these
mild and diluted versions of libertarianism, people will then
be drawn into accepting the more “extreme” manifestations
of libertarianism, as if being enticed into the back room of a
pornography shop.

The error embodied in this kind of “realism” is the confusion
between someone on the one hand being told an idea, and on
the other hand *agreeing* with that idea. These are two absolutely distinct processes, and understanding this distinction is
the beginning of wisdom as a libertarian propagandist. There
are, to put the same point slightly differently, two ways of
being an “extremist”. One consists of not only expressing
one’s views with clarity but also of trying to combine this
process with that of immediately being agreed with, of saying what you think and of saying why the person you are
talking to has no excuse for thinking otherwise. This is obnoxious and counter-productive. Your victim will simply
back away, and make a note to seek other conversational
companions in the future. The *right* way to be an extremist
is to say what you think and why, while absolutely *not* assuming that the person you are talking to has any sort of
obligation to think likewise, and if anything while making it
clear that you rather expect him not to. You think what you
think, and he thinks what he thinks. And if he hasn’t told
you already what he does think, then an obviously polite
next step would be to ask him to talk about that. The two of
you can then try to pin down more precisely how you disagree, assuming you do. It is possible to be an extremist
without deviating from good manners, and that is how.

Another obvious way to present an “extreme” idea to
somebody, in a form which does not grab him by the lapels
and shake him around and generally spoil his day, is to present that idea in writing. Publishing is, you could say, a
branch of good manners. No matter how “extreme” is the
opinion I may read in a pamphlet or magazine, I am never,
so to speak, at its mercy. I can stop reading it at any moment, and so in the meantime I need not feel threatened or
even discomforted by it. The number one task of the Libertarian Alliance is simply to get the libertarian case spread
around - especially in writing of course - to anyone who is
interested in it. *Whether any particular reader agrees or not
doesn’t matter. The point is to spread the ideas.*

## SPREADING AN IDEA WHILE OPPOSING IT

Often an “extreme” idea can be spread by someone who
vehemently disagrees with it. Since many libertarian ideas
are aimed at Marxists, and since some Marxists, for all their
vices, do at least enjoy reading about political and philosophical ideas, libertarianism is now far better understood by the
more thoughtful members of the Marxist sects than it is by
“the public”. The consequence is that such Marxists are now
helping to spread a real understanding of libertarianism to all
whom they happen to discuss it with.

I recall an argument with a Marxist, in which I followed the
rule of being understood rather than agreed with. With no
great unpleasantness, the Marxist formed a far clearer idea of
what libertarianism was than he’d had before (and liked it
less than ever, of course). *He* then had an argument with his
flat mate, and told this flat mate that the flat mate and I were
made for each other, as we seemed to agree about everything. The flat mate and I duly met, to our mutual benefit.
He turned out to be one of those “My God I thought I was
the only one who thought like this” libertarians, of the type
one is occasionally lucky enough to encounter and put out of
his isolated misery but so seldom does. He happily gathered
up a couple of armfuls of Libertarian Alliance literature, and
quickly converted himself from a gut libertarian to a gut-and-brain libertarian. Thus, a crucial piece of pro-libertarian
communication was achieved merely because one libertarian
had taken the trouble, politely but with great “extremity”, to
be understood by one *anti*-libertarian.

By the multiplication of such undetectable dramas as this, the
libertarian message is well on the way to being *understood*
by an amazingly large proportion of educated people with
any interest in such matters.

## SHIFTING THE MIDDLE GROUND

The effect of spreading libertarian ideas is to change the
agenda of debate. It doesn’t immediately change the conclusions that people have already reached as a result of their
previous thinking, but it does change what will from then on
be thought about. The middle ground, in other words, shifts
in a libertarian direction.

Once again, the larger, historical process can be illustrated at
the level of the small conversational gathering. Suppose a
group of people are talking about whether or not marijuana
should be legalised, and on balance thinking that since marijuana may, they surmise, be harmful, it would probably be
wiser not to legalise it. In such circumstances, all it takes is
just one person to transform the conversation utterly. For if
one person says that the issue is not harmfulness or lack of
it, but the right of the individual to decide about harmfulness
for himself, and that not only marijuana but also heroin
should be legalised, then from then on it will be a totally
different conversation, and a much more libertarian one.
And that will be true even if the dissident is merely stirring it
by introducing a libertarian viewpoint which he happens not
to share. The dissident may, for example, be a Marxist
schoolteacher trying desperately to get his vegetable-like
charges to stop clock-watching and to start thinking.

People like Marxist school teachers, by the way, often respond with unexpected warmth to the notion of abolishing
compulsory school attendance, if only because this would
turn them from jailers into real teachers. That causes them to
look again at libertarianism generally, the way they never
would if all they were offered on the educational front was
yet another tedious pamphlet on education vouchers, “academic standards”, and so forth. Many Marxists become
Marxists merely to make extremist mischief, and they make
Marxist mischief only because unaware that there is any
other kind of mischief to be made.

Another fine example of the beneficial influence of “extremism” is to be found in Nick Elliott’s description of how the
argument about libertarianism went on inside the old Federation of Conservative Students.
See [Libertarian Alliance Tactical Notes No. 3](http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/tactn/tactn003.pdf), *What To Do and What Not To Do.*

## THE MYTH OF CONSENSUS

Much of the potency of “extremism” lies in in the widely
held but false idea that people have to agree about fundamental philosophical ideas in order to live peacefully
together in society. This is not so. The world is full of
people with wildly different views about the philosophical
foundations of life, of the universe and of everything, yet on
the whole they get along peacefully enough. Where there
are major breaches of the peace, these are just as likely to be
between peoples with near identical views on “the fundamentals” as between people without such philosophical affinities. Nevertheless, the myth persists that if the
“ideological spectrum” is stretched too much, not only will
this metaphorical spectrum break into metaphorical fragments, but that “society” itself will be shattered into real
fragments, and that these real fragments will then attack one
another. This picture is foolishness, but when someone in its
grip confronts his first cheerfully anti-consensualist libertarian extremist, he is likely to react with something close to
panic. He is also likely to bend over backwards to agree
with as much of libertarianism as he can, so that the fabric of
society may be preserved. The libertarian case need only be
stated with clarity in a particular social milieu for this process to go into automatic effect.

Once the “consensualists” see the point of libertarianism,
they will see also that liberty works fine, and that extreme
ideological diversity is by no means the automatic threat to
society that they had supposed. What matters is the superficial rules that different ideological groups agree to accept
in the meantime. Freedom - freedom in practice, that is - is
deeply attractive to all sectarians. Even those groups who
are in theory most determined to suppress freedom, such as
Marxists, Moonies, fascists, Muslim fundamentalists, and so
on, find themselves lapsing into libertarianism when it comes
to their right to go on peddling their own propaganda, and
each group will cheerfully surrender freedom to the others if
that is the only way that it too can remain free.

## WINNING BY NOT WINNING

Another way of phrasing all that I’ve been saying so far is
this. Having stated what arguments you intend to win, don’t
try to win them straight away. The actual winning of arguments is one of those mystically oriental activites in which
trying is best done by not trying.

When was the last time you *won* an argument, right there in
front of you? When was the last time someone said to you:
“By heavens! You’re right about this, and I’ve been wrong
about it all of my life, until you took the trouble to straighten
me out. How can I possibly thank you? Let me, as a pitifully small token of my infinite gratitude, kiss your shoes.”?
Not recently, I would guess.

When did *you* last surrender to *somebody else* in an argument, on the spot. I can recall having done this a couple of
times in my life, but the interesting thing is that on each
occasions I later decided that my surrender was premature,
and, in the privacy of my own mind, so to speak, I withdrew
my surrender. I recall, for example, being persuaded - and
admitting out loud - that marijuana is more dangerous than I
had supposed, and that therefore the case for keeping it illegal was stronger than I had been arguing. Later I realised
that the truth or otherwise of these assertions was beside the
point. Safety was not the issue.

It’s important not to confuse actual persuasion with mere
point scoring, which usually only works if there are third
parties present who will register the points. The person actually scored off is unlikely to be so impressed. That someone doesn’t have his ideal riposte immediately available, at
the top of his brain, as it were, doesn’t mean that he won’t
think of it later, or in the meantime be convinced of anything
except of his own relative slow wittedness, which has no
bearing at all on the question of what is or is not true. The
truth is not logically dependent upon the mere argumentative
facility of those discussing it. Indeed, if your opponent can’t
immediately think of replies to your various sallies, you
could do a lot worse than suggest a few counter-arguments
against what you’ve said for him. Sir Karl Popper has done
this, when disputing in print with Marxism. As he says,
what does it prove if you “win” only against badly put or
ill-remembered arguments? Surely you want to engage with
the ideas you oppose at their most formidable and persuasive.

Many of those who say that they dislike arguing say it because they imagine that they have a duty to win arguments
on the spot, score cheap points and so on, and that those
whom they argue with will feel similarly obliged to push for
victory, in other words that when people argue they *have* to
be objectionable to each other. But once you have understood that the goal of argument should be, not one directional
“conversion”, but mutual comprehension then it becomes
much more fun. Arguing is a lot like sex in this respect.

But be warned. Arguing, also like sex, is dangerous. You
may, as Robert Nozick puts it in *Anarchy, State and Utopia*,
be infected by the truth, that is, by the truth that the other
person is telling you. If your cause means more to you than
the truth, you would be happier not communicating effectively with others. The Libertarian Alliance is not interested
in gathering converts of this feeble and ineffective kind. We
consider being understood and opposed far preferable to
being misunderstood and thus “agreed” with.

## HAVING SET THE AGENDA, DON’T THEN INSIST ON SETTING THE AGENDA

So, the agenda has changed. You have planted a stronghold
in the territory of the enemy, and he is now attacking it.
You’ve argued, for example, that heroin should be legalised,
and never having heard so outrageous an idea before, he
can’t get it out of his mind. At this point, switch from polite
offence to polite defence. The pattern with all arguing is,
first establish your camp, then cool it. Act, react. During
the defending-the-camp phase you must do a tactical somersault and let the other person decide what is to be talked
about.

For example. You’ve said you are a libertarian, and he’s said
he’s not, and at that point you are letting him say what he
wants, and he says something like: “What about El Salvador?” (Or Chile, or South Africa, or the “Third World”, or
any place where “capitalism” is generally held to be doing
less than brilliantly.) The *wrong* reply to that is the all too
familiar “right wing” counter-blast: “What about Russia?”
(Or Hong Kong, or West Germany, or any place where the
argument for liberty is strong and the opponents of liberty
have more or less given up.) All that “What about Russia?”
does is convince the anti-libertarian that libertarianism has
nothing to offer on the subject of El Salvador. The *right*
answer to “What about El Salvador?” is: “Yes , what *about* El
Salvador? *Tell me about it.*” Let *him* tell *you* what he wants
to argue about, that is to say, while you decide the fundamental principles of the argument, let him decide what
particular application of those principles the two of you then
talk about. You decide that the argument is going to be
about “capitalism”, and he decides that it’s going to be about
capitalism in El Salvador.

Several benefits follow. First, the argument continues. If,
like me, you like arguing, your purpose is not served by you
insisting on freedom in general and the badness of life in
Russia in particular, and that El Salvador is irrelevant. It
takes two to tango. Why should he enjoy a conversation
whose agenda he had no say in shaping? The chances are
he’ll be away.

Second, you address your opponent on those topics that are
of interest to *him*. This is always the trick with any kind of
persuasion. First announce your product, and try to spin out
the conversation about it. You do this by finding out what
your audience wants, and you try to explain, if you can, why
your product will supply this. In the case of El Salvador,
find out what the man thinks is now wrong with El Salvador
and explain how your ideas might improve things, and why
his ideas might only be making things worse.

Third, you will learn things. One of the great problems of
the propagandist is “research”, that is, discovering and deploying the relevant “facts”. One of the best places to find
facts is in the pronouncements of your opponents. They are
hardly going to deny these facts, having supplied them themselves. What you must do is argue that they don’t prove
what your opponents are saying they prove.

Recently, for example, I encountered the familiar complaint
that capitalism spends fortunes on cars and fridges for the
masses, but refuses to spend fortunes on *education* for the
masses. Rather than getting bogged down in the details of
exactly how true this is, I instead pointed out that insofar as
it is true, this is because cars and fridges are made and sold
in a free market, while “education” tends not to be. Which
is an argument not for more government spending on education but for less. This “more money should go to education
and less to cars and fridges” argument is a particular
example of J. K. Galbraith’s constantly recycled observation
about the ubiquity of (a) private affluence and (b) public
squalour. But is this, as Galbraith and millions of others
hold, an argument for having less private affluence and more
public squalour? Hardly. Take your opponent’s facts, and
deduce something different from them to what he is used to
deducing. Using your facts isn’t going to impress him. Using
his just might make him think a bit. And you can’t use his
facts if you aren’t willing to attend to what they are.

## HOW PEOPLE REALLY THINK

This point about not expecting to win arguments on the spot
is more than a matter of mere pride. The notion that one can
“convince” somebody of the truth of libertarianism with one
mere “argument” is rooted in a false model of how people
think about political matters. Political thought is rooted not
merely in “facts” but in contrasting “world views” or
“models” of how the world is and how it ought to be improved.

Think back to how you first became a libertarian, if you did
(or if you didn’t, how you became what you did become).
The chances are that no one “fact” was decisive, or that if
there was one moment of “conversion”, this was merely the
culminating point of a much more complex process of
thought, involving many “facts”, concerning the rival merits
of your old world view and the new one which you eventually switched to.

Speaking for myself I switched from vague socialism to unvague libertarianism through thinking about education, the
economy, architecture, foreign affairs, and a dozen other
things I can’t now recall, and no one “fact” from any of
these different areas would have caused me to change my
mind. It also mattered a lot to me that there was a libertarian *movement*
that I could join, and which could read what I
wrote (given that I already knew that I wanted to write) and
which would ensure that I still had an abundance of like
minded friends. The truth would not have been nearly so
attractive if there had been no one to share it with. That may
seem superficial, even illogical. Nevertheless, that is how it
was. So I now try to remember that other people may accept
(or resist) libertarianism for similarly “illogical” reasons. For
some anti-libertarians it comes as a shattering revelation to
learn that there actually are real live libertarians, and that we
mean what we say. Until then they had assumed that people
only believed in capitalism for the sake of their dividends.
The mere *existence* of a sincere libertarian might for such a
person be the decisive, conversion-inducing “fact”.

More generally, the fact that it takes many arguments rather
than just one to win “the argument” with any particular opponent means that even if he *accepts* what you have just told
him about El Salvador or education or fridges or whatever,
he may still insist on remaining an anti-libertarian, at any
rate for the time being, and that you must accept this with
good grace as the natural way of things.

One of my greatest objections to the mostly admirable Ayn
Rand is that she never seemed to grasp this point about the
way people arrive at their opinions, and hence about the
proper way to try to change their opinions. Rand always insisted on the power of “reason”, or as I would prefer to put
it, on the satisfaction of winning her arguments with one
punch, on the spot. Apparently there was once an “argument” between Rand and Mrs Murray Rothbard. Mrs Rothbard dared to indicate that she believed in Christianity. Rand
patiently explained why Mrs Rothbard was utterly and completely mistaken. Mrs Rothbard replied that although she
saw the force of Rand’s arguments her religious views were
unchanged. Rand promptly dismissed Mrs Rothbard as a
hopeless case, impervious to “reason”. Not surprisingly, Ayn
Rand became a very lonely old woman. (But notice that although this pamphlet explains what was wrong with Rand, it
also explains what was so right about her. Although bad at
conducting herself in the arguments she started *she did at least start them*.
As an agenda shifter Rand was a genius.)

Rand’s woeful inadequacies in some aspects of the art of arguing and excellence in other aspects of it illustrate a general
point about winning the libertarian argument, which is that
the process is a team effort. For one libertarian on his own
to “convert” someone else to libertarianism, without any help
from any other libertarian or any other argument from anybody else, is an unimaginably rare event which negates the
very idea of civilisation, and of any sort of shared intellectual culture. As I have written elsewhere (in
Libertarian Alliance [Cultural Notes No. 15](http://www.libertarian.co.uk/lapubs/cultn/cultn015.pdf), *Design as Outcome*), to
understand in detail how any particular enterprise is conducted is simultaneously to understand how that enterprise
may be shared between different people. As with design so
with arguing. Many of my long suffering conversational
friends will for some time now, while reading this, have been
muttering to themselves that I am a lot better at preaching
politeness than I am at practising it.

You, by contrast, although perhaps less good than me at proclaiming the libertarian message,
may have a particular willingness or talent for distributing it, or for organising meetings at which libertarianism is proclaimed. You may excel
at translating libertarian ideas from something sounding extreme to something which sounds moderate and unthreatening. Or perhaps you contribute crucially to the cause simply
by (a) calling yourself a libertarian when asked what you are
but not otherwise, and (b) being a nice person in all other
respects. By merely proving that libertarianism and decency
can cohere in the same personality, you will be a walking
advertisement for the cause, as I might not be.

Most especially, there are now many libertarians who excel
in the ancient and by no means entirely ignoble art of crawling,
and who are thereby inserting themselves inside organisations which
might expel them if they went on about
libertarianism all the time the way I do. Then, when the opportune
moment arises, mealy-mouthed centre-rightist or leftanarchist Clark
Kent sets aside his spectacles, and anarchocapitalist Superman steps
forward! People with plans like
this would be useless without people like me, because the
opportune moment would never arrive. But nor would
people like me count for so much without people like them.
Personally, I think that things would be greatly improved if
more people were prepared to flaunt their red underpants on
a permanent basis, for reasons which I have already explained. But in the end, people do what they want to do. A
Clark Kent libertarian certainly has his uses, and is undoubtedly an improvement on no libertarian at all.

## THE VALUE OF REPETITION

Those who have read other Libertarian Alliance writings of
mine besides this one may perhaps feel that they have heard
some of the things in this piece before. If so, they feel
correctly. (See in particular
my [Tactical Notes No. 7](/la/tacn007.html), The
Tyranny of The Facts, and my closing comment
in Political Notes No. 42, *A Conservative Manifesto for Scotland* by
Antoine Clark and Tim Evans.) So it makes sense for me to
end this piece by noting the value of sheer repetition, a point
so closely related to what I’ve been saying above as almost
itself to be a repetition.

I said in Tactical Notes 7, and have repeated here, that
people do not form their view of a political event or policy
or cultural object on the basis of only one small set of facts,
but decide about particular issues in the light of their total
world view. Not only that, a person’s world view determines
whether he or she is interested at all in any particular argument or item or fact. The chances are that hardly any of what
you say will even be registered by your reader (or conversational companion) and that most of what is registered will
soon be forgotten. There’s no particular dishonour involved
here; this is just life. We all experience far too much in our
lives to remember all of it, and most of what we experience
means virtually nothing to us, because it has no bearing on
the few matters about which we are thinking seriously. Accordingly, any propaganda enterprise must get used to repeating its message. This is true for the entire enterprise, and it
is true for its individual members. I don’t mean that you
should say the same thing four times within ten minutes, although even this kind of repetition can sometimes be necessary. I mean merely that you may have to say the same thing
week after week, or in pamphlet after pamphlet, before it
gets properly attended to. Many will *hear* your message
time after time, but only at the thirtieth hearing will they *receive*
it and *take it in* and attach it to their slowly developing and changing world view, which is only then ready to
accept what you have been saying. Expecting to have to say
everything only once is a variety of the I-want-to-win-with-only-one-punch arrogance that Ayn Rand indulged in. But
even Rand did the important things right, because she did at
least understand the value of getting things published, that is,
mass produced and able to repeat themselves by being read
again and again, even if she herself had no patience for repeating things verbally.

For the same reason, it really doesn’t matter if you have
some great idea for a piece of libertarian writing, but then
come across someone else saying it before you got around to
writing it. He probably wasn’t the first to think of it either,
and you should write the piece anyway, again, in your own
words. If it was worth saying once, it’s worth saying again.
Something about how you phrase the point will probably
cause some readers to take it in for the first time, despite
having heard it or read it several times before in other forms
but without registering it. Would-be Libertarian Alliance
writers please note, and don’t be surprised to read that point
again, in another edition of Tactical Notes I have in mind to
do, about how to write for the Libertarian Alliance. Indeed,
if the significance of repetition as a technique of persuasion
interests you sufficiently, you might care to rephrase the
thought yourself, in yet another LA publication.
