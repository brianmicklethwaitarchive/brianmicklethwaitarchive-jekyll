We are slowly adding more pamphlets. In Libertarian Fiction No. 3: [The Lion's Share](/la/lific003.html), we discover the life of Starshine McKane and his evil ambition to murder everyone in the world.

> Starshine decided to become a capitalist, but not one of Karl Marxâ€™s regular capitalists, galloping in golden blinkers to their doom. Starshine would equip himself with weapons of mass destruction. Come the glorious day of supposed proletarian liberation, he, Starshine McKane, forewarned by Karl Marx that revolution was imminent, would slaughter the rest of humanity, now conveniently destitute, and take sole possession of the world and all its wealth.
