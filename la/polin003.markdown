# A reaction to the television series 'Dahrendorf on Britain'

BRIAN MICKLETHWAIT

First published in 1983

During the last week, the first of the year 1983, a television series called
“[Dahrendorf On Britain](https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/104c8f0bfd114d2c843e3a6e53cfb360)” was shown.
Ralf Dahrendorf is the Director of the London School of Economics and
a former Eurocrat. Although German he is now a full member of
Britain’s club of the Great and the Good, from whom Royal Commission
members are chosen, and he has been on several of these. The
prepublicity for his show included a lovingly detailed close-up of
his *Who’s Who* entry, suggesting what a formidable fellow he is. My
father, who also used to do well in *Who’s Who* and with whom I was
watching this, asked me what I thought of Dahrendorf, and I upset him
by snapping out that I considered the man about as influential as a
cork bobbing about on the Atlantic Ocean. My father replied that maybe
this was because I didn’t like what he said, not because nobody
listened to it.

Rather to my surprise I have been proved totally right.
Last night’s episode was a startling finale to this truly
bizarre series.

It was a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Conservative
Party.

What made this spectacle so astonishing was that it had been preceded
by a succession of bore-ins on behalf of the Tendency of the Extreme
Centre, occasionally on behalf of the Social Democratic Party itself,
and at its worst on behalf of that Party’s leader the Right Honourable
Roy Jenkins M.P.. I didn’t see all these other bore-ins, so I bought
the book of the series (Ralf Dahrendorf, [On Britain](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Britain-Lord-Ralf-Dahrendorf/dp/0563200723),
BBC Publications, 1982), and this is even more boring. It contains all
the televised cliches and more, but none of the pictures or recordings
of others boring besides Dahrendorf.

## NATIONAL REGENERATION BY CONSULATIVE GATHERING

People I’ve met who have switched on Dahrendorf at random have mostly
said that the man was saying absolutely nothing; simply spouting an
uninterrupted gush of centrist vacuities. (One day a member of the
Great and the Good is going to reply: “There are no easy answers” only
to realise a fraction of a second too late that the question was:
“Tell me Lord Boredom, what does two plus two equal?”) Nevertheless,
emerging like a multistory car park from out of the fog, a distinct
theory could be observed, by those who persevered. Namely: a country
does well when those who rule it all agree to do well. The country’s
rulers (the people in *Who’s Who* such as, to name but one, Ralf
Dahrendorf) sit down in ever widening rings of committees,
consultative gatherings, regular meetings convened by the Prime
Minister, and so on and so forth. What, you ask, do they do? The
following Dahrendorf sentence catches the drift well: “There is a need
to reach at least procedural conclusions on guidelines for action.”
Not: action. Procedural conclusions on guidelines for action. Later
(this one is my absolute favorite) Dahrendorf says: “If there is a
common understanding of issues, even a common definition of major
problems, a framework of action is created which itself forms ...”
What, for a bonus of ten points, does it form?  Offer it. Answer: “a
guideline”. *A guideline!!!* The Japanese are just going to be queueing
up in their millions to buy our bloody guidelines!

Being a committee man Dahrendorf also gives due weight in his
ramblings to entirely different theories, which, he hints, could be
just as true as his preferred theory, and perhaps (who can be sure?)
even more true. He is a sociologist by background, and is thus
incapable of being certain about why things happen in society, indeed
unable to grasp that anyone ever could be certain about such things.

Speaking of “bloody” guidelines Dahrendorf is, naturally, opposed to
“adversary” politics. This he regards as totally different from the
civilised search for consensus, and he is thus saddened by the way
Britain has oscillated back and forth between these two unrelated
styles of government. But they are the same style. X announces a
national consensus which all are urged to accept. Y tells X where he
can stick his consensus and X replies to Y in much the same
tone. Consensus politics *is* adversary politics. Contrariwise that
arch-exponent of adversary politics Margaret Thatcher will, if she
wins the next election, have established something suspiciously like a
consensus, even if it is only a consensus that it is unwise to cross
this demented virago. Which of course was her idea in the first
place. She will not help us, e.g. by employing us. So, there’s nothing
for it, we must help ourselves, and employ ourselves. It was just
this newly emerging consensus that Dahrendorf ended up by describing.

The SDP isn’t nearly such a good bet now as it was when Dahrendorf
began work on his series. If, as now seems possible, this woman is
going to be enthroned for the next fifteen years, and if one wants
continuing employment knitting together the consensus, then perhaps
one should somewhat change the colour of one’s wool.

## PRODUCERS VERSUS PREDATORS

The truth is that countries stagnate when the people in them agree to
stagnate, and do not stagnate when the people in them do not agree
stagnate.

Producers of goods produce goods, and consensus politicians attempt,
with varying success, to put a stop to this process. Producing
requires no consensus, so producers act quickly. Consensus takes time,
so the politicians are to begin with left far behind, but eventually
they get their act together and bring the producers to heal. Anything
which discredits politicians (like defeat in a major war) without
installing new, powerful and undiscredited politicians (as in Eastern
Europe) is good for production. The acquisition of another half dozen
states of the union, or joining a customs union like the Common Market
consisting of a bunch of damned foreigners, is good for production,
because suddenly there is this vast army of blacklegs which the
producers immediately exploit but which it takes the politicians a
generation to subjugate.  For detailed exposition of the above, see
Mancur Olsen’s
[The Rise and Decline of Nations](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rise-Decline-Nations-Stagflation-Rigidities/dp/0300030797)
(Yale University Press, 1982). Olsen is an economist. He finds things
out. He says why his theory is true and other apparently equally good
theories untrue. He only writes a book when he has definite answers to
report, and after you have read his book, some of these answers are
easy.

## SELF HELP

Dahrendorf’s final episode, at which the book scarcely hints, was the
result of a systematic search for success stories in the
disintegrating wasteland of Thatcherite Britain. Cleverly omitting all
reference to Thatcher, Dahrendorf described (1) a small computerised
steel mill in Ebbw Vale, (2) a vocational training centre cum product
R and D operation, somewhere or other, run by a disillusioned school
teacher, who was using “unemployable” black youngsters to do the
soldering for some promising sounding electrical gadget designers, (3)
a part-time all female computer software consultancy firm in Horsham,
Surrey, and (4) a self-help amuse-yourself community group in
Glasgow. All are apparently doing nicely. The first and third are
making money, and the other two appear to be staggering along without
major outlays by anybody, if only because no outlays are available.
Dahrendorf was describing a world in which all the expanding spider’s
webs of common understandings, shared guidelines, consultative thises
and local authority thats (in other words, the world of Ralf
Dahrendorf) had simply collapsed into oblivion. The people were on
their own.  If they couldn’t save themselves from catastrophe, then
catastrophe was going to engulf them. But, and this was the good news,
the same state apparatus that was so powerless to help them was for
the same reasons much less well placed to stop them doing things, such
as building a laundrette in the hitherto “zoned” Glasgow housing
estate. What could the council do to prevent such insubordination?
Withdraw its support? It provided none.  Cut off “community
development aid”? It was cutting it to ribbons anyway. It was all the
people in the council could do to pay each other their salaries.

Is it too fanciful to hope that people who are now one hundred per
cent responsible for their own lives may come to resent paying fifty
per cent taxation in exchange for absolutely nothing, and may one day
even decide to stop doing this?

If such a consensus ever does emerge then Ralf Dahrendorf can be
relied upon to say something encouraging about ... let’s see now
... this seemingly retrograde but in fact very positive contribution
towards defining Britain’s role for the future.
