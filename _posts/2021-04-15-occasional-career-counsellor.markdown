We are adding more pamphlets. Today, [Helping People to do Freedom: Reflections and Recollections of an Occasional Career Counsellor](/la/persp013.html). Brian explains his approach to
giving people career advice, and in doing so gives a lot of good advice. He notices that many people feel bad about wanting to do well or get rich, and his response pre-empts Jordan Peterson's advice:

> Doing as much self-help as you can is, I would say, more of a moral obligation than an immoral indulgence. Look after yourself and you won’t be expecting or begging others to look after you, and you’ll be better at looking after them if they need it.
