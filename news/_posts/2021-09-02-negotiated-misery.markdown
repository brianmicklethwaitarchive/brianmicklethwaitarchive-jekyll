Today, we re-publish the blog post [Micklethwait's Law of Negotiated Misery](/blog-highlights/2021/09/02/micklethwait-law-negotiated-misery.html). This describes the problem of
accepting less money for work you love, so ending up doing work you hate to get more money. This may explain why people are so miserable even though the world is getting
better and they have more choices.

> How much do you get paid to do [work you hate and are good at]? Chances are you get paid good money. Why? Because you will only consent to do work you hate if you are paid good money. So, with no great effort, you hold out for good money (even if all you thought you were doing was Just Saying No), and, because you are good at the work, you get paid good money. Eventually, someone makes you an offer you canâ€™t refuse, and you take it.
