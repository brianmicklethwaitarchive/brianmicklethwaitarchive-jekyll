We will be slowly adding more pamphlets. Today, Libertarian Alliance
[Personal Perspective number 17](/la/persp017.html) describes Brian's
discovery of blogging. It tells the story of how Brian met Perry de Havilland
and how the libertarian blog [Samizdata](https://samizdata.net) was founded.
It goes on to discuss the difference between being a loser libertarian and being
a winner libertarian.
