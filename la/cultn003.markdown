The world abounds with spontaneous
architectural orders. If a group of people
all seek to build similar structures with
similar materials, to solve similar problems of accommodation, all in one area,
the result will be an orderly cluster even
though no one decision-maker imposed
the pattern. Pattern comes from the repetition of the same materials and shapes,
either because each designer arrives independently at the intelligent answer, or because the intelligent answer, once established, is then copied, with minor variations. The result is often not merely
architecturally satisfactory but beautiful,
all the more so because of the variations
in the individual structures. Crystal clusters, in which the individual crystals are
similar in shape but not identical, are
often beautiful in the same way as architectural design.

The humble terrace of town houses or
high street shops did not originate as a
single act of design. It was the consequence of different householders and
shop owners individually seeking their
separate frontages on the same street, like
people jostling together to watch a procession. The (not at all obvious) rules
concerning how best to build and inhabit
terraces *evolved* long before any architect
was able to apply the results of this learning process to the conscious creation of
single terraces all built at one time. The
terraced glories of Georgian Bath or
Regency London could not have been designed without this earlier period of trialand-error terrace building by multitudes
of now unknown artisans. Imposed
architectural order is not automatically
wrong. It is what architects are paid to
do. What matters is whether architects,
in the regularities they do create, use the
knowledge evolved and embodied in
spontaneous orders, or whether they turn
their backs on it.

## THE SKYSCRAPER CLUSTER

Recent examples of spontaneous architectural orders are rare. One glorious exception is in the form of the skyscraper
cluster, which first burst onto the architectural scene in Chicago and New York
in the latter half of the 19th Century, and
which is now a feature of all major cities
whose planners do not (as in London)
forbid it. The first skyscrapers were denounced by the American East Coast
architectural establishment. They were
the result of a happy alliance between
steel salesmen eager to find other applications for their product besides railways
and railway bridges, and architects who
were more concerned to satisfy the
wishes of their customers than to submit
to the architectural inhibitions of their
day. Skyscrapers cluster because all the
landowners in city centres face the same
problem (how to maximise floor space in
a part of town where rents are very high),
but permit one another only one direction
in which to go to get the answer (up).
The famous Manhattan skyline is a sky *line*
because land values vary continuously rather than discontinuously, not because any one person ever drew that line.

## ONLY ONE MENTAL CATEGORY

If the first recognisably ‘modern’ buildings were monuments to human freedom
and to the technological ingenuity that
freedom had nurtured, the so-called
‘modern movement’ in architecture was
quite different. The modern movement
vision of the architectural future was first
publicised in the 1920s by such books as
Le Corbusier’s *Urbanisme* and Walter
Gropius’ *The New Architecture and The
Bauhaus*. (Gropius’ Bauhaus, based first
in Weimar and then Dessau, Germany,
until it succumbed to Adolf Hitler, was
without doubt the most influential school
of architecture and design in the 20th
Century.)

It wasn’t that Le Corbusier, Gropius and
their allies and followers could not see
architectural order. For the idea of order
(a word which Le Corbusier often emphasised with italics or capital letters) mattered to them very much. The problem
was that they had only one mental category in which to place it. They saw
either imposed order or no order at all.
The modernists denounced spontaneous
terraces and spontaneous skyscraper clusters
as unmitigated chaos, the characteristic product of the chaotic free market.
And the highly regimented terraces then
more typical of cities than the new excitements of Manhattan were dismissed
by the modernists as tyranny, even
though such terraces were directly based
on the evolved terraces of earlier times
and were built, rented, bought and sold
by free people on the free market.

The modernists accepted skyscrapers, but,
in order to introduce the natural daylight
and rural healthiness that they considered
desirable, separated them from each other
by wide expanses of ‘public open space’.
In other words, all the inconvenience and
expense of high-rise building was accepted while its one great benefit, an immense floor area to site area ratio, was
thrown away. Nearer the ground the
modernist rejection of evolved architectural patterns was just as damaging. Terrace-like buildings were proposed which
were at least as tyrannical as anything
built by the hated 19th Century property
developers. But these structures were
separated from the roads which are the
original reason for terraces in the first
place. Pavements (that is, paths bounded
by roads on one side and houses or shops
on the other) ceased to exist, for no better
reason than that the modernist architects
regarded them as muddled and unsafe.
We now know, from bitter experience and
from the analysis of such writers as Jane
Jacobs, that compared to ‘public open
spaces’ pavements are very safe indeed.

## THE WRONG LESSONS LEARNT

It was Jane Jacobs, whose classic *The
Death and Life of Great American Cities*
was published in 1961, who introduced
the idea of spontaneous order into mainstream architectural commentary. But
having been so disastrously ignored by
the founders of the modern movement,
the concept was then sentimentalised and
trivialised by their successors. Spontaneous architectural order was equated
with the small, ‘human scale’ architecture
of far-off times and faraway places. The
architecture magazines became filled with
picturesque aerial views of Italian hilltowns, African hutclusters, intricate Arabic townscapes and the like. Such things
are indeed beautiful, but the wrong lesson
was learnt from them.

Architects grasped that there is something
desirable and distinctive about spontaneous architectural order, but, making the
very same error as the early modernists,
they identified this distinctive feature to
be ... chaos. Only now they called it
‘variety’, ‘humanity’, ‘complexity’, and
so on, and regarded it as a good thing.
Architects are now building pseudo-spontaneous orders, that is, places which are
not the product of many different interacting plans, but which *look as if they are*.
Bland slabs of office *circa* 1955 are confronted fifteen years later by assymetrical
cascades of little boxes, like cottages
tumbling down the side of a mountain, or
like a crystal formation.

For such a contrast look at the two sides
of Victoria Street, London SW1, at the
front of Westminster Cathedral. The famous Byker wall, in Newcastle, looks
like a gypsy encampment carved into the
side of a cliff, an effect achieved by permitting individual dwellers to select their
preferred exterior colour scheme from a
range of choices offered by the architect.
Council estates that would earlier have
been done as a lumbering herd of identical concrete monsters grazing in a prairie,
in the manner of the award-winning Roehampton Estate of the ’50s, are now
being tricked out to look like fishing villages, with randomised changes of brickwork and steeply pitched roofs. This
latter tendency has been especially marked, for some reason, in the County of
Essex, where a special Council manual
was produced to spread the correct new
style.

This outburst of bogus spontaneity has
not been a wholly disastrous development.
It is not necessary to know why a
spontaneous order works well for copying
it to be a wise strategy. ‘Noddy houses’
is the name sneeringly given to the new
picturesque style by orthodox modernists,
but these Noddy houses are prettier than
the old tower blocks, to most eyes. Because the Noddy house designers are imposing an architectural effect based only
in a very picture postcard way on anything ever built before, they are now perpetrating the same kind of unplanned
disasters (dampness, disintegrating plaster, absurd heating bills, etc.) hitherto
only associated with tower blocks; but
some fishing village virtues are recaptured. For example, if disaster strikes a
cluster of Noddy houses only selectively,
individual dwellings can (unlike those in
tower blocks) be ripped out and replaced,
without everything else having to go as
well, and without the overall effect being
spoiled.

## LET FREEDOM COMMENCE

However, these pseudo-spontaneous
architectural orders raise a question mark
against the entire legislative and institutional setting within which architecture is
now practised. When the modern movement in architecture was launched, there
was no talk of muddle being picturesque.
The need was for order, grand simplicity,
a perfectly straight skyline, and vast,
green, open spaces. This vision has now
collapsed, and is being replaced by a very
different one, but the institutions established to make the old vision come true
are still all in place. Yet if pseudo-spontaneous orders are now considered desirable, what is wrong with the real thing?

If the appearance of architectural freedom
is now considered beautiful rather than a
mess, why may not free people be left
alone to get on with it?

Why may they not keep their numerous
little plots of land, the institutional precondition for a genuine spontaneous
architectural order, and do exactly what
they want with them.

Why are planning departments needed at
all, if the plans of mere people are now
acknowledged to interact in a satisfactory
way?

Why brainwash aspiring architects in
monastic government-funded seclusion if
what they are now required to do is what
their clients would have wanted them to
do anyway?

Let architects learn the architecture of
freedom from their customers, and from
their professional seniors best skilled at
satisfying these customers. The logic is
inescapable: close the planning departments and fire the planners, abolish compulsory purchase orders, close all the
schools of architecture except those that
entrepreneurs can run at a profit. And let
freedom commence.
