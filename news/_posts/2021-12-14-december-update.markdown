On the last Friday in November 2021, an event was held at Brian's flat
in which his friends were invited to help themselves to his enormous
collection of books. The books are being catalogued. So far it is mostly
the books that were taken on that night that have been added to the catalogue
but the plan is to add them all. The catalogue so far can be
[viewed on libib](https://sjgibbs.libib.com/i/brian-micklethwaits-library).

Meanwhile, we continue to add Libertarian Alliance pamphlets written by Brian. The latest one very much brings to mind
Brian at his grumpiest, which is to say with a slight twinkle in his eye. You knew he meant very seriously what he was saying,
when he was like this, but there was no deep hostility in it.

In [Tactical Note 11](/la/tacn011.html), Brian very much wants people writing for the Libertarian Alliance to include footnotes.

> A standard response to libertarian criticisms of collectivist viewpoints is the claim
that “no one says that”. If you quote directly from someone who
does, and state in crushing detail exactly what and where it came
from, then that argument at least is unavailable to your critics.
Someone does say it. Here he is saying it. Here’s where you can
find him saying it, and saying more in a similar vein. You don’t
win intellectual wars by appealing to the opposition’s sense of fair
play. You win by shoving the truth under their noses in a way they
can’t ignore without at least some ignominy.

> And we are
becoming *utterly contemptuous* of people who, when all of the
above has been explained to them with searing eloquence, then *argue* about it. We are also acquiring a hearty contempt for the
universities, most of whom no longer bother routinely to inculcate
into their inmates this elementary scholarly procedure, upon which
all other scholarly procedures depend. (Many of those who object
to our footnotes complaints actually have university degrees!)

...

> “Late 1970s”. What the fuck use is that?
That’s six unnecessary hours in some damn library. That’s twenty
well referenced articles about environmental scaremongering in the
media that *won’t even be written*. Would it really have been such an
effort for anti-footnote cretins to have had to drag their weary eyes
past *International Wildlife*, “No. 189, November 1977, p. 27”, or
whatever? Or to have had a little clutch of numbered small print at
the end of Anderson’s piece to ignore?

The piece also includes a footnote arguing against what would now be called [clickbait](/la/tacn011.html#fn:12).
