...very soon after I came to London in 2002 and [Brian] introduced me to all kinds of interesting people and interesting ideas. And almost all of my friends
[in London] can in some way be traced back to having known him. He is very generous with his ideas and very generous with his friendships. This has been
a fine, fine thing.

...please do not feel co-erced in any way ... please do not feel like you have to say something. The fact that you are here [pleases] Brian, but if you want to say
a few words about how Brian has inspired you put your hands up ... let's start with Tom over here.

## Tom Burroughs

Well, first of all I want to stress that I haven't been co-erced. ... I met Brian in 1985, when you were working in the Alternative Bookshop. I came across this little
bookshop by one of those small forks in the road that we take, and we look back and think, my god, here am I sitting in a room in Westminster in 2021, and it goes back
to a tiny advertisment in the back of the Spectator advertising London's only anti-Marxist bookshop.

It was a hot day. It was July, I was at Brighton Polytechnic, that august educational establishment, and I was becoming frustrated with [what] I was being asked to read
by my college tutors. I went to the bookshop and I went back three or four times. I remember one evening George [...] the American writers, sort of champion of supply side economics
was holding forth, and I had a very good evening. As I left to get the last train home, I got nobbled by Brian who I would describe as a sort of ninja bookshop worker.

He said, "you've been here several times." And in the sort of classic Brian bluntness he said, "I'm going to get you to write for the Libertarian Alliance. Here are some
pamphlets. Study the form. I think you've got something inside you." And he pressed me and cajoled me into setting my ideas out in print. And several of the pamphlets ...
I wrote them. I can remember right now the pride I had in writing them, and more to the point all the feedback I got from Brian about how to craft things better.

I'm now a journalist. I've been a journalist for three decades. And I can't tell you how important it is at the early stages of your career, to have people like Brian and Chris
and others to give you the confidence to set about putting your views in print. And as Tim has said, there is no college tutor who is better than this man at giving
this kind of high-altitude advice.

And these things work out in funny ways. In 2003 I had my first or second date with my wife sitting next to me, and she told me later that she did a Google search on me
to check me out (this is the world we live in, chaps), ... and she said I did a search on Tom Burroughs and loads of things came up including a piece about "The joy of
shooting, in defense of the posession of firearms", and she obviously worked out that I was some kind of weird eccentric. And discovered the complete archives of the
Libertarian Alliance, at least the ones that I had written. And so one of the consequences of writing for Brian and his colleages over the years is that my wife has
come to understand what a strange piece of work I am.

Brian, it's been a pleasure to be your friend for more than 32 years. All I can say is thank-you very much indeed for all of the guidance, support and friendship you've
given me over the years, it's been greatly inspiring. Thank-you.

Hello, Brian. I'm going to keep it short. I'm really glad Simon reminded me how we met because I was trying to think about it and I just kind of assumed that you magically
appeared in my life somehow. I wasn't quite sure how it happened but I'm really thankful that Simon reminded me.

We've talked on email briefly since your diagnosis, but one of the things I'd like to touch upon is that a few years ago now we went to [Simon's] wedding and we also went to
Richard's wedding and I learnt two things about you at those weddings. One is your love for photography, and your interesting in taking pictures of people taking pictures.
I went through my Dropbox account looking for my old pictures and I did find a picture of me taking a picture of Richard and Naomi while you were taking a picture of me. Which
I thought was great.

But one of the key things I think I learnt about you at those weddings was you have an incredible ability to engage with anyone. And to communicate with anyone. I regard myself
as a reasonable communicator but you are an incredible communicator and you are incredibly engaging with people. You engage with anyone from any background, wherever they're from
and you can engage with them on lots of topics. At these weddings we weren't at some sort of libertarian conference, we were at, like, a wedding where normal people go.

And you were able to engage with these people and have nice conversations and endear yourself to those people. And I think to some degree that explains tonight the reason there are
so many people here from many different backgrounds and walks of life. They're here because you have engaged with them. And you have an incredible ability to engage with anyone.
And I just think that's a testament to your ability generally, along with all the other things people have touched upon.

## Dominic Frisby

Hello everyone, my name's Dominic Frisby for those of you who don't know me. I have a weird double-life as a financial writer and a stand-up comedian. A career, by the way, which
has been encouraged by Brian. And in the world of comedy - we tend to associate comedy with, you know, some famous guy doing his act on the telly: a Netflix special, a panel game,
a big sitcom, something like that. But in the sort of comedy eco-structure by far and away the most important area, without which comedy wouldn't function, is the new material night
where you go out and you try some new material. And it's essential in that environment that you have some kind of free speech; that you're able to say whatever you like and know
that you won't be castigated for it. And you intentions won't be misinterpreted. Because without that you can't experiment and find new ideas, or anything like that.

And so that is the key part of the comedy eco-structure. And I think, Brian, your world ... of freedom, of liberianism, you have been ... you have been open spot night, you have been
new material night, you've been the person that gets people started. And in my own case I remember once upon a time I had this idea for a stand-up show about tax. And I thought no,
there's no way I can go and try that out in a regular comedy club and Brian said, "try my front room".

And we did a stand-up show about taxation in Brian's front room and it became a sell-out show at the Edinburgh Festival and it became a very successful book endorsed by none other than
Mark Littlewood of the IEA. And you know it all began on one of those Friday nights.

Another time I said, I've got this idea for a game show about finance. It's a finance game show and again Brian said, come and do it in my front room. And we did the whole show on one of
those Friday nights.

And I think I'm repeating what everyone else has said but through this other lens that Brian's role has been this incredible... you know in footballing terms he's the guy that's training
the players at grass-roots level and getting them all started and encouraging them. And that is way more important than the guy who puts on the [...] gigs. So thank-you, Brian.

I remember the first time I met you, which was when I came down to the alternative bookshop in Longacre in Covent Garden. I met you and Chris Tame there. And I seriously think that was one
of the most significant and transformative moments of my life. Because what I did then, I not only discovered you as a friend and an intellectiual interlocutor, but also I think you did
various things for me then and subsequently. One of them was that, as Tom has said, you encouraged me to write. You encouraged me to take the crazy ideas I had and put them down into words.

But also you challenged me. I was constantly having conversations with you there in Covent Garden in which you would say something which would challenge some idea I had or you would say something
which I thought: I'm sure that's not right. And either I would come to agree with you or I would still disagree but I would know why. And so I thought that played an enormously important part
in clarifying my thinking by leading me into exploring some things that otherwise I would not have done.

But also I remember one of those Fridays at your flat in Esterbrooke Street and being absolutely staggered by the sheer amount of CDs of classical music you have on your walls. And also the
interesting shelving system you have with planks of wood held up by used Nescafe jars.

...and through you I met an amazing amount of people. And I have to say, Brian, I looked at the attendance list for this event I was thinking good lord, look at all of these people I know, and
I know all of them through you. And I think that that network building and bringing people together is an enormous kind of legacy. And I think all of us here share that with you.

I was glad also I was able to invite you up to my own place in Manchester and I don't know if you remember but you did say to me afterwards that the experience of being at my family dinner table
was like being in a live Coronation Street episode. ... I can tell you my wife and my daughter still remember it vividly. It was a wonderful experience. But I can only say that I'm enormously
grateful I met you had an enormous impression on my life and I'm sure upon the lives of everybody here. And that indeed is your legacy.

Lots of us have known you for a long time. I actually go back 60 years or so. Brian Micklethwait: The early years. Instead of the single minded man here now: a bit of a contrarian.
We met when we arrived at school together at 13. We were in the same [...] house. We did get to know each other quite well. At the end of the summer term I invited you back home on
bicycles. We were at boarding school and my home was 200 miles away. And we did cycle the 200 miles. How many parents would let 14-year-olds do the length of Wales and end up in
Cheshire?

Anyway, we've kept in touch and we've had several interesting converstaions. But I do remember thinking of you, going back to those early years, as a contrarian. Because you had a
reputation of being a sort of a sparky mathematician in the early days, and when the mathematics got really interesting and the exams started getting a bit closer and things,
actually, you [became] deep, deep into architecture. Whatever you were meant to be doing, you were doing something else.

It did work because Cambridge did pick you up to study architecture. At the time my college was quite close to the school of architecture and you used to turn up with a gaggle of
your architecture student friends. But actually by then architecture had slightly lost its lustre.

[...]

But anyway the school of architecture threw you out after a year and you found yourself in Essex. [Brian: I went to Essex.] You went to Essex! You went to Essex by choice.
... Except of course by the time you got to Essex, there was nothing more fascinating than [Anne Brown?]. And Anne Brown totally absorbed your life. Somehow you survived all of
this but you didn't quite land up with a qualification for any job that you would have been prepared to take on. ... Brian is very good at driving a van, and for some time he
was delivering [number plates] the length and breadth of Britain.

The Brian Micklethwait then was very logical, and he thought that the problem with the world was that there wasn't any central control. ...and I do have some of these writings!
He thought at great length about world government. Those number plate delivery trips were so long that you had so long to think about world government, you actually could see
some of the problems associated with [Steptoe's?] thinking, and bit by bit, you became the Brian that we know today.

Brian Micklethwait the early years. I enjoyed the early years. I've been in touch sporadically. I haven't been to that many of the last Fridays. We don't quite agree on all matters.
I believe firmly in the hidden hand, or whatever it is, pointing in the right direction but I'm quite happy to let wise people decide the speed at which we should go in some of
these directions.

But anyway, Brian, it has always been...  [...] I don't know. You just mention something with Brian and before you know it you're into an intellectual discussion, and you're deeper
into it than you imagined and it's always fascinating. Many thanks, Brian.
