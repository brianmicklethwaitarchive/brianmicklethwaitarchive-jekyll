It began as friendship. I said: I like personal success books. She
said: how does that stuff apply to me? I did my best, in a conversation that must have lasted about two hours, and apparently it
helped. Friends of that friend, and friends of those friends, also
gave it a go. Word-of-mouth has kept the customers coming ever
since, in a steady trickle.

I’m not like a careers master at school. I don’t know that much
about CVs or about how to do job interviews. I try to get people
to discover what makes them tick and what they truly want, and
what ideas might be inside their heads which are stopping them
from doing what they want.

I usually charge my customers something, if only to clarify that we
are discussing their careers and not just chatting at random. I
don’t try to make big money by counselling, because that would
take away the amateurism of it which now makes it feel comfortable. My usual payment is £20 and most are happy with that,
although I’ve done some sessions for nothing. (People with career
crises are sometimes very short of cash.) For the rest, £20 is a
small enough sum for them not to have to believe that they got
good advice if they feel they didn’t. They’re paying me to try, not
for any guarantee that I’ll succeed. To make a serious living at
counselling I’d need to charge nearer £50 per session, and to justify a fee like that I’d have to have qualifications and be an expert.
At which point I might start apologising for my homespun wisdoms and be tempted to wrap them up as objective knowledge.
Maybe I should try to move up in the world, and sell my services
to people for whom £200 is small change. Perhaps this piece will
shift my counselling career in that direction.

## COUNSELLING MUST BE NON-DIRECTIVE

Some counsellors don’t believe in actual counselling, that is, in
offering advice. But offering advice and forcing advice down
someone’s throat are surely distinguishable. Often my customers
need to decide their next step quickly, and they genuinely want
some suggestions from outside their regular circle of friends or
familiar thought processes. Advocacy can distort judgement, but it
can also aid it, especially if it is offered in a way that makes plain
its fallibility. Advice, even if gone against, makes for better decisions, because it provokes the discussion of further unconsidered
alternatives. My advice is only that, my advice. It isn’t “professional”. It’s not science. It’s just how I see things. I’ve lived a
bit, done some things well, done other things badly. And, I’ve
read books, such as how-to-be-successful books, and such as biographies — which tell of how famously successful people have got
into lots of the same career muddles as the rest of us. The only
training I’ve done was a short local authority course run by a man
who directed us, as eloquently as his disbelief in being eloquent
allowed, that counselling must be non-directive.

The non-directiveness people do have a point. I recall directing a
play at university and being amazed at how different it looked to
me as I sat among the first night audience to how it had looked in
rehearsal. Actors who had shone in rehearsal were upstaged by
others who had seemed ordinary. Jokes fell flat, while other lines
which we didn’t even realise were jokes brought the house down.
The point being that talking about your ambitions and problems
with a counsellor — who is another sort of audience — can transform the way you then see them, and the counsellor need not say
anything for this to be so.

## FIND OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND TELL THEM TO DO IT

I prefer a mixture of directiveness and non-directiveness. Most of
us can remember being thanked for advice which we hardly gave.
Here’s how that can work.

COUNSELLOR: So. What’s your dilemma? Why do you think
that talking through your career choices with me might help?

RECEIVER OF COUNSELLING: Well, I’m torn between becoming a Licensed Confuffulator, which is what my parents want,
and being a wadgellist, which is not as well paid but which
would be far more fun if I could make a go of it.

C (slowly and thoughtfully): I see.

ROC: Yes, being a confuffulator does make a lot of sense, and I’d
certainly be better able to support a family ...

C: ... and having a family is important? ...

ROC: Yes, eventually. And provided that I can supply my family
with quecks and digdogs and so forth.

C: I see. But you’d prefer to be a wadgellist?

ROC: Exactly! It’s great to be understood so clearly. So few of
my friends seem to get that. They just go on about how confuffulating would be more secure.

C: Would it?

ROC: Probably. I guess.

C: But maybe, if you became a confuffulator, you’d not be able to
concentrate because at the back of your mind would always be
the thought of how much more fun you might be having if you
were wadgelling instead?

ROC: Yes that’s true! I would probably hate it.

C: Are there failed confuffulators who don’t earn much?

ROC: Lots.

C: So becoming a confuffulator wouldn’t guarantee lots of quecks
and digdogs?

ROC: No.

C: However, you’re worried that being a wadgellist might also not
provide quecks or digdogs. Is there any way you could be a
well-paid wadgellist. Are there many rich wadgellists?

ROC: Qute a few, but it’s a very competitive field.

C: What do the rich wadgellists do that the others don’t?

ROC: That’s an interesting way of looking at it. Wow! Hm.

C: You wouldn’t perhaps feel that becoming a rich wadgellist
would mean that you’d sold out?

ROC: Definitely not! I’d love to be a rich wadgellist!

C: What’s stopping you?

ROC: Well for starters I don’t have any pluggles.

C: How could you get some pluggles?

ROC: I suppose I could ... er ... do a bit of jippering.

C: Jippering. Hm. Are you good at that? Does it pay well?

ROC: Yes. I wouldn’t want to spend my life doing it, though.

C: How much jippering would you have to do to afford some
pluggles?

ROC: Well, let me see. Er ... about a year, maybe two.

C: Would that be a problem?

ROC: No, not really.

C: Right. Here’s my first preliminary suggestion, which could be
all wrong but ...

ROC: Yes, yes, what are you saying?

C: Do some jippering. Buy some pluggles, and become a wadgellist. Try to be a rich wadgellist. If your parents object, tell them
that this is what will make you most happy.

ROC: Wow. Yes. That’s brilliant! How do you do it?

Okay, I’ve played this scene for laughs. But I don’t need to know
about confuffulating, wadgelling and the rest of them to offer
worthwhile advice, and I believe there are some crude yet eerily
effective computer programs which prove this. Simply: find out
what the customer wants to do and tell him to do it. I want to do
A, he says. So why not, I reply, do A? I can’t because of B.
How could you deal with B? Well, I could do C. So do C. Yes,
but for that I need D. What could you do to get D? E. So: do E,
get some D, use it to do C thereby dealing with B thus enabling
you to do A. Gosh, Brian, you’re a genius. But all I’ve done is
lay out the logic of what is being said, unconfused by any knowledge of the details.

The mere thought that my customer might be able to spend the rest
of his working life doing what he would most enjoy often releases
a surge of pleasurable energy, such as he had before been unable to
find or had thought himself too old for. I try to make my counselling customers happy and I often do, sometimes dramatically.

I do suggest things that my customer might do, but he tells me
what he wants to do before I bounce that back at him. I don’t
insert outside judgements (your parents are right about confuffulating, which is better than wadgelling — digdogs don’t matter —
jippering is beneath you). His circumstances as he sees them are
my starting point, rather than any irrelevances about what I might
want to do, were I facing such choices, with my tastes, my preferences and my values.

## NO OBVIOUS RAILS

Many people — young people especially — are not in the habit of
thinking logically about their own career choices, because they
have not been in the habit of freely making such choices. Others,
such as parents, have mapped out their futures for them and put
rails in front of them.

Riding along on rails supplied by others is not a crime, but it
becomes a problem if someone or something rips up the rails. You
fail some vital exams. You get the sack. Your whole patch of the
economy goes into decline, or suddenly gets more competitive.
You have a “mid life crisis”. Your plan to become the Grand Panjandrum of the British Federation of Confuffulators fails, and
merely being part of a brand-X confuffulation partnership no
longer appeals. What do you do now? No obvious plan presents
itself. You have no obvious rails to proceed along.

Maybe you’re on rails of your own making (you’re a wadgellist!),
but for reasons you can’t pin down, or which don’t seem “reasonable”, travelling along them has lost the magic that it once had.

You’re used to being logical about other things. What’s two plus
two? What caused the Napoleonic Wars? How can we expand the
wadgelling market, and capture more of it? How can wadgelling
be computerised and put on the internet? But you may not be used
to applying such thinking to your own life.

## SELF-HELP

Worse, you may have been persuaded that it is *wrong* to think
logically about your own career anxieties. This is “selfish”. You
have “responsibilities”. You must think only of what you “must”
do, how you must deal with “real life” rather that “fantasy”, and so
on. Counselling, then, can get results simply by “allowing” people
who are used to thinking logically about other things to do the
same for themselves.

Women can be especially afflicted by the notion that thinking logically about their career worries is “selfish”. And a typical male
mistake is to think that being uncertain about how to live your life
means that you are weak and unmanly. Real men aren’t confused!
Real men just do it! But there is nothing either wrong or weak in
thinking about how to live as you want. Doing as much self-help
as you can is, I would say, more of a moral obligation than an
immoral indulgence. Look after yourself and you won’t be expecting or begging others to look after you, and you’ll be better at
looking after them if they need it. People who look after themselves tend to be those who have thought about how to do it.

## THE LINE BETWEEN THE MORALLY NEUTRAL AND THE MORALLY WRONG

The assumption that self-help is wrong is a particular example of a
general tendency which I encounter in many of my customers.

Maybe, one day, someone will ask for my advice about whether to
keep their present honest but unexciting job, or to take up the offer
they’ve recently had to become a criminal. I guess I live a sheltered life with only law-abiding friends and acquaintances because
so far this hasn’t happened. No, the “moral” problem my customers have is not that they reject or ignore morality, but that they
often reject or ignore morally unobjectionable career options, for
reasons that they speak of *as if* they were moral reasons. It’s
“wrong”, they imply, to go against the wishes of one’s parents, or
to follow the wishes of one’s parents, to work part-time instead of
full-time, full-time instead of part-time, to want to get rich, or not
to want to get rich. I recall one man who felt ashamed of the fact
that he wanted to get rich *so that he could look after his father*.
But ashamed is how you should feel about murdering or assaulting
or robbing people. There’s no corner of Hell labelled: “People
Who Wanted To Look After Their Fathers”. By getting assumptions like that into the open, they can be made to lose their force.

## PARENTS AND HOW TO IGNORE THEM

Parents often loom large in my counselling sessions.

Here’s how I see the parent thing. Your parents want you to be
happy. Most of them say this, and they almost all think it even if
they don’t say it. To make sure you become happy they give you
advice, and it plays over and over in your head like a tape loop:
“Get yourself a trade!”, “Be a lawyer!”, “Don’t be too ambitious!”,
“Don’t be an artist!”, “Do something real!”, and so on.

Suppose you want to reject some such piece of parental advice.
How will your parents react? I tell my customers that they’ll
probably take it quite well. Assuming that they truly do want you
to be happy, and if you truly don’t believe that following their
advice will make you happy, then once they’ve seen that you’ve
made up your mind they’ll step aside and wish you all the best.

People who go for what they truly want are far more likely to
impress their parents than those who follow their mere instructions
obediently, but without enthusiasm and with concealed rebelliousness. Do anything in that spirit and you’ll probably fail. Do your
own thing with all your heart and soul and you’re far more likely
to do well. And because your deepest values and beliefs are profoundly shaped by your parents, you’ll almost certainly, if you follow your own path, end up doing something that will deeply
impress them, despite all your superficial defiance. This is surely
what the parable of the Prodigal Son is partly about.

In the unlikely event that your parents truly don’t care if you are
happy, but merely want you to be a credit to them or to live out
their fantasies, or something else involving their interests but not
yours, then do you really owe lifelong obedience to such people?

## THE HUMAN MIND IS COMPLICATED

The human mind has been compared to a mansion, with many
rooms. Quite right. The mind is not a single small room, with
everything laid out clearly and obviously. If it was, counselling of
the sort I do would be superfluous, because the workings of your
own mind would be obvious. But they are not obvious, and you
are not a fool merely because you sometimes find your own
thought processes muddled and baffling. For years on end you
may have had one ambition in one room, so to speak, and a quite
opposite way of thinking in another room at the other end of your
mental mansion. An outsider, unconfused by detail, can sometimes spot connections or contradictions between different
thoughts, in different parts of your mind, that you don’t see.

A favorite American method for jerking people out of their usual
thought patterns is to yell at them. Arsehole! But taking a fresh,
look at your life need not be unpleasant. Being confused about
your own thought processes and ambitions is not evidence that you
are stupid, and certainly not that you are an “arsehole”.

One of my more fondly remembered sessions was with the man
who wanted to get rich to look after his dad, but who was also
keen on higher education, and on computers. What should he do?
Get rich? Stay in higher education? Or get into computers? I
suggested that he start or join a company which applied computers
to higher education. Bingo! He’d never thought of that. This man
was absolutely not stupid. He knew more about computers than
I’ll ever know. It was simply that the various things which were,
as the saying goes, “staring him in the face” were doing this from
different parts of his mind, and buried under or lying next to other
things that were confusing the issue. It took an outsider to put the
right things next to each other.

## WRITE IT DOWN

But you can do this for yourself. You yourself can get outside
your problems, so to speak, by treating them just as you would
treat other problems. It regularly amazes me that intelligent, educated people, who wrestle every day with complicated chunks of
verbiage about matters that are external to themselves, have never
thought through, on paper, their own lives and their own careers.

Do you face a tough this-or-that decision? Put the reasons for and
against this in two columns, and the reasons for and against that in
another two columns. Cover a pile of scrap paper with words,
graphs and diagrams, just as you would if you were reorganising
an assembly line or setting up a company IT system.

Writing and re-writing a piece like this one using only a computer
screen would for me be like studying a horse using only a magnifying glass. The same may apply to your career thoughts. You
may be experiencing each thought only in isolation from the rest.
So do a complete print-out, so to speak. Write down all your
thoughts. Lay them all out in front of you and see how they might
all fit together.

Writing down *all* your concerns also alleviates anxiety. Career
paralysis is often induced by the fear that, whatever step you take,
you will ignore important but unnamed and unexamined considerations. So name them. Examine them.

## EVERYONE IS NOT LIKE YOU

A common unexamined assumption is that we are all alike.

Suppose you believe this. And suppose you want to be a brain
surgeon. At the back of your mind — maybe even at the front of
it — is the notion that everyone else, being just like you, also
wants to be a brain surgeon. So what chance do you have in such
a cruelly competitive field? But most people do not want to be
brain surgeons. They aren’t like you. Their parents raised them
differently. They know different things, studied different things,
get excited about different things. The number of people wanting
to be brain surgeons is accordingly fewer than you are assuming.
So give it a go, if that’s what you really want to do.

Your particular way of looking at the world is not “normal”, not
“usual”; it is highly distinctive and individual. Things you do with
ease and for fun are things which others would refuse to do no
matter how much anyone paid them. Things that you think about
naturally baffle others completely. If you can fit your very distinct
way of doing things to a distinct niche in the big world out there,
you could do really well.

## WHAT ARE YOU LIKE?

So it is that much of what I discuss with my customers concerns
what sort of people they truly are, and what they truly enjoy and
truly care about, given that this is bound to be unusual. I have a
whole repertoire of questions to help tease this out.

What have you most enjoyed doing? What have you done best?

What would you be willing to fail at? What would you only want to do if you were sure of success?

Who are the people you’ve most enjoyed working with? What was so special about them?

When you can do as you like — when all duties are done, all
homework completed, all debts paid, all colleagues satisfied, all
obligations to “mankind” fulfilled — what do you do? Not: what
does your fancy idea of yourself make you wish that you did?
Simply: what do you do? Do you seek company? Of what kind?
To do what? Are there crowds and noise, or just a few friends?
Or are you alone? Again, doing what? (Could you try doing it
anyway? If someone paid you to do it, wouldn’t that be great?)

If you had all the money, talents and qualifications in the world,
what would you then do? Would you lie on a beach in the sun?
Or would you actually do quite strenuous things, like sport or
travelling? (Again, could you do this anyway?)

What do you daydream about? (Do your daydreams fit what you
tell yourself are your ambitions?)

## WHAT IS YOUR MODEL OF THE WORLD?

How do you think the world works? How do you apply yourself
to that world? Do you see the world as essentially an arena of
conflict, or of harmony? Are things done by big teams or small
teams? Where do you fit into such teams?

Part of my answer to questions like these involves not just people
but ideas, as this piece of writing illustrates. Ideas, as I see the
world and as I see myself in the world, rule the world. Good and
bad ideas that people have about the world, and about their places
in the world, spread themselves around and interact with one another, on their own and in clusters. I grab hold of some of the
good ideas and amplify, simplify or polish them, and send them
back into battle against the bad ideas. Both my counselling
sessions and my writings for the Libertarian Alliance are me doing
this, and there’s lots of overlap between the personal and the political. There is conflict in my world, but it is between ideas and
within people, rather than between people.

Not true, right? There are other things about how the world works
which are at least as important and, according to you, far more
fun. Which is my exact point. The way I see and do things is not
the way you see and do things.

Just as I give advice which can be gone against, so I often describe
my model of the world, and other models which I’ve heard about
from other customers, to get a reaction from my present customer.
He responds with his own contrasting model, and realises better
than before how very individual his model is.

Once I am able to see the world through my customer’s eyes, we
can together brainstorm new and enticing career ideas, for him to
adapt and build on at leisure. If travel comes naturally to you,
why not be a travelling salesman, or work for a travel company?
If you think people can’t be trusted, why not be a security guard,
or get into industrial counter-espionage? If what matters to you
most is distributing wealth from the lucky to the unlucky, how
about insurance? Such suggestions may not identify a new career
by name, but they will help to describe what the right career will
include and feel like.

## VISUALISATION

A common error is to suppose that you can’t decide what you daydream about. You can, but how do you change daydreams if
you’ve nothing appealing to change them to? Creating a picture of
your perfect life and visualising that is part of the answer. And, as
all the creative visualisation books will tell you, to visualise your
perfect life is itself a big step towards getting it. The picturing
keeps the destination in your mind, and when chances to move
towards it present themselves you’ll take them enthusiastically, and
in a way that also excites others and gets them on your side.

Visualisation also works for little things, like habits you want to
drop or behaviour patterns you want to cultivate. Picture yourself
doing what you want, and soon you will be.

## BREAD DECISIONS AND BABY DECISIONS

Often my contribution is more modest than I have been implying.
Some of my customers already have their plan, and their conversation with me is not so much a cause of their future career triumphs
as a sign that these triumphs have already started to unfold. What
they need from me is one more check-out, one more look at the
scheme from another angle before the plunge is taken, plus whatever tips and tweaks I can suggest.

A recent customer was of this sort. The main thought I added was
merely that there were plenty of things she could do to start putting her plan into action without taking any “plunges”. She had,
she said, been “irrationally” reluctant to make a change. She had
withdrawn from the later stages of job interviews, and had even
turned down jobs she was offered, “for no reason”. Actually, at
the back of her mind was the fear of jumping irrevocably from one
imperfect but bearable life into another that might be far worse,
and there’s nothing irrational about that. A thought isn’t irrational
merely because you don’t have it at the front of your mind, and
tricked out in the words you need to tell yourself, or me, about it.

What I hope I supplied to this lady — aside from a general optimism about her prospects that I definitely felt after talking with her
for a while — was the distinction between the many acts of reconnaissance which she could now energetically do while keeping her
present job and income, and the actual kissing of her current job
and income goodbye, which would be something else again.

I call these two sorts of decision bread decisions and baby decisions. Bread decisions may safely be done one small slice at a
time, with benefits coming straight away. Bread is worth having
in small slices, even crumbs. But a bit of a baby isn’t just worthless; it’s a catastrophe. Baby decisions must be done all at once,
with no holding back. If you really would rather dig ditches than
work one day longer at your present job, fine. But if your current
life works okay and you’re merely trying to improve on it, you
might want to be more cautious. Maybe you should spend more
time sussing out new possibilities, to the point where jumping to
one of them ceases to be much of a risk and becomes pure gain.

This bread-baby distinction refers back to the question on the previous page which asks: what would you be willing to fail at?
What, for you, would be a satisfactory version of only becoming
“half a brain surgeon”? Brain surgeon’s assistant? Brain surgeon
in another less grand country? Writer about brain surgery? Some
other kind of surgeon? Or would being half a brain surgeon be
like having half a baby? If your career really is an all-or-nothing
deal, and you’re okay with that, then okay. I prefer a fall-back
position, and so might you if you thought about it some more.

## THE PROBLEMS OF FREEDOM

A common complaint is that there’s now too much counselling
going on. Whatever happened to old fashioned friendship, and to
stoicism in the face of adversity? You have problems? Pull your
socks up and deal with them.

Insofar as this counselling trend involves the mystification and
false professionalisation of old-fashioned neighbourliness or
friendship, or people being encouraged to wallow in their problems
instead of ever dealing with them, I share such suspicions. Nevertheless, this trend towards people like me selling their friendship
services, so to speak, is happening for real reasons.

The trouble is that the world has become fuller both of opportunities and of complexities, but that the traditional sources of advice about how to deal with these opportunities and complexities
have become less abundant. People now have more freedom. I
realise that it is not usual in a pamphlet published by the Libertarian Alliance to describe freedom as trouble, but it can be.

I recall being told how it felt for a lady from a formerly communist Eastern European country to enter a western-style supermarket.
If you wanted toothpaste, in an old-style commmunist shop, your
only problem was: did they have toothpaste in stock or not? If so,
fine, you got your toothpaste. If not, you waited until a supply of
toothpaste arrived and you joined the queue. Easy. Often exhausting and time consuming, but easy. But in a London branch of
Tesco’s, there are about a dozen different sorts of toothpaste! How
do you choose? Why is the cheaper toothpaste cheaper? (What’s
wrong with it?) Why is the expensive toothpaste so expensive?
(What’s so special about it?) The simplest purchasing decision
plunged the wretched lady into a paroxysm of indecision. The
more choices you have, the more choices you must make and the
sillier you feel if you get them wrong. Freedom in this sense can
be a burden. You find yourself wanting freedom from freedom.

And if the freedom to choose between different brands of toothpaste is for some a burden rather than a pleasure, how much more
true is this of the process of choosing what to do with the rest of
your life?

In days gone by you did what your father or mother did, or you
chose a job from the dozen or so jobs that your immediate surroundings offered to you, or if you were the adventurous type you
ran away to the Big City and played it by ear. Now, modern communications technology brings a thousand alternative lives to
choose between into every living room and even child’s bedroom.
People now compare themselves with world famous high achievers
instead of merely with locally famous ones, and have become far
more ambitious. Career counselling has exploded for the simple
reason that more people now want “careers”.

But the opportunities other people have mean that there may be
less personal advice available — less “unconditional positive regard” as we counsellors say — than in simpler, slower times.
Need to talk your problems through with someone? Why not try
your dad? Not easy, if your parents are divorced and you’ve not
seen him for ten years. So get to know some wise old soul in the
pub and bend his ear. Again, tricky, if he’d prefer to be watching
football on the giant cable TV that the pub has recently installed.

## REBELS AND NON-REBELS

It’s easy to exaggerate all this. Most people find friends with
whom to talk through their worries. The rebel who siezes his freedom when young, hangs out with other rebels, sorts out the
meaning of life in company with his mates, and then chooses
when, where and how to rejoin respectable society, needs no
“counselling”. He knows how to handle freedom, because he’s
been doing it since the age of fourteen. He knows that his choices
can turn round and kick him in the face, because he’s been through
that a dozen times. The world is full of ultra-effective adults who
were only ultra-troublesome when young.

But some rebels get into trouble, trouble and more trouble, and
counsellors swarm around them like flies. Not being a “professional”, I’ve not had a crack at counselling any such people, although I’d love to try.

And then there are the non-rebels, the educated ones, the swots,
who stay on the rails, do their homework and don’t rebel. They
can also get into big career muddles. These are the ones who
delay longest in cutting their parents down to size, and in deciding
whether the rails their parents have laid out in front of them are
really how they want to travel. Being intelligent, they mostly deal
with their dilemmas and have successful lives, but meanwhile
someone like me can be quite a help.

## OTHER WRITINGS

This piece doesn’t say everything about how I do my counselling,
but it says something. What matters to me is that people read my
stuff, or do one of my counselling sessions, and then think better
about the world and its ways, and about how they might function
happily and effectively in it.

I hope that, just as I try to make my counselling sessions fun for
my customers, so reading this has been fun for you. If you have
enjoyed it, you might also like a previous Libertarian Alliance
piece by me called [What The Success Books Say](psycn007.html) (Psychological
Notes No. 7, 1992), which, unlike this piece, lists some other more
famous and expert writings than mine about how to make your life
and career go better.
