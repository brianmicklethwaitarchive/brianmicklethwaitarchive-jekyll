# IEA event

On September 3rd 2021 the Institute of Economic Affairs hosted an event entitled _The Life of Brian: A Reception to Celebrate the Life of Brian Micklethwait_
in Brian's honour at their headquarters in Lord North Street, London.

At the event, [formal speeches](iea_speeches.html) were given, which I have transcribed.

Following this, the microphone was passed around and many people spoke about Brian and his influence on their lives. I am in the process of writing down as much
of these comments as possible.
