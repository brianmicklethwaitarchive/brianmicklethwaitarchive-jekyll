          <p>The world is full of tasteless
          advertisements. What should be done? A law against
          tastelessness might seem the obvious cure.</p>

          <p>But why shouldn&#39;t people be tasteless
          if they want to be? It&#39;s too vague a category, and too
          subjective. We may agree that tastelessness now runs riot,
          but will surely disagree about which adverts are the most
          tasteless. The adverts which I find the most tasteless of all
          are often those where the advertisers have gone out of their
          way to be &quot;tasteful&quot;. There&#39;s now a TV ad
          running, for a CD of operatic excerpts, in which a couple is
          shown arriving at the opera house, in a horse drawn carriage.
          He looks like a standard issue Mills and Boon hero, i.e. he
          looks like a male model and is therefore probably gay. And
          she looks like the kind of person who&#39;s head is so
          stuffed with Mills and Boon that she doesn&#39;t realise
          he&#39;s gay. It is all filmed in a very soft focus, olde
          worlde manner, and is to me a total travesty of the true
          spirit of opera. I cringe every time I see it.</p>

          <p>But I wouldn&#39;t want this advertisement
          made illegal merely because I don&#39;t like it, and I invite
          others to be as tolerant of the bad taste of others as I am.
          Lousy taste should be allowed. New born babies and HIV
          positive beggars should be allowed in Benetton adverts.
          Adverts for smutty talking telephone services should be
          allowed in the Daily Sport. If people want to advertise
          clothes that look as if Gary Glitter has chucked them out for
          being too naff, fine.</p>

          <p>But won&#39;t this create a lot of misery?
          Won&#39;t people be upset on a huge scale? Not necessarily.
          The answer to the conundrum is that we should all make
          greater use of the institution of private property.</p>

          <p><b><font size="+1">Private Standards and Public
          Chaos</font></b></p>

          <p>Suppose that most &quot;public&quot;
          places were &quot;privately&quot; owned. Suppose that not
          just newspapers and magazines and cars were each
          someone&#39;s private property, but that the same rule
          applied also to parks, shopping centres, railway stations,
          and above all the streets and the electronic media.</p>

          <p>The same kind of advertising rules would
          emerge, I suggest, as have already emerged in the newspaper
          business. You don&#39;t get adverts for smutty telephone
          calls in the Times or the Economist or the International
          Journal of Advertising. But you do get them in the Daily
          Sport complete with small pictures of the smoldering lovelies
          with whom you are being invited to converse. So, if you want
          to avoid being offended by such adverts, avoid the Daily
          Sport.</p>

          <p>But now consider television. (ITV makes
          much of its &quot;I&quot;, which stands for
          &quot;independent&quot;, but ITV is only a government
          franchise, renewed following a gigantic political row every
          few years, and heavily policed and fussed over by the Great
          and the Good in the supposed national interest, just like the
          BBC.) It is far harder for TV viewers to avoid being upset by
          what they see and hear. In the case of the two TV channels
          which may advertise, just about every advert will offend and
          upset some people, the viewers all having been herded by the
          government into watching the same emaciated television
          service. The sort of advertising allowed in this ludicrously
          restricted enclave is inevitably a bitter public issue.
          (Exactly the same applied in the early days of printing.
          People now snigger at sixteenth century bishops who used to
          agonise about what the few licensed printers should be
          allowed to print. The descendants of these same bishops now
          make identically fatuous statements about state-licensed TV
          and radio.)</p>

          <p>But suppose there really was a free market
          in broadcasting. Suppose that television channels really were
          &quot;independent&quot;, and no harder to buy than nightclubs
          are now. Suppose there were as many TV channels as the
          techno-wizards could contrive. There would immediately be a
          flowering of TV specialisation, in the manner of the press.
          There would be posh, arty shows, with small but rich
          audiences, interrupted by the sort of adverts that rich
          people will tolerate and be moved by. There&#39;d be scumbag
          tabloid TV shows, far tackier than we have now, paid for by
          tasteless adverts like the ones in the Daily Sport.
          There&#39;d be aggressively masculine and managerial shows
          about how to Lead Britain Out of Recession and Achieve
          Inflation-Free Export-Lead Growth (with adverts for hotels
          and seminars and gold plated fountain pens and portable
          computers). There&#39;d be TV for gardeners (with weedkiller
          adverts), for sports-men (with adverts for running shoes),
          for sports lovers (with adverts for beer and cigarettes), for
          tasteful classical music lovers like me (with adverts for
          opera without those damned horse drawn carriages), and for
          tasteless classical music persons with the carriages. And so
          on and so on. Result: much more pleasure and profit for all,
          and much less offence caused by surprise horrors, which one
          was watching this particular channel precisely to avoid.</p>

          <p>Suppose streets and shopping centres were
          all privately owned, and the same kind of variety of public
          mood was allowed to emerge there as well. In the event that
          anybody except a few feminists truly cares about the matter,
          there would undoubtedly emerge a few shopping centres where
          the feminist dream law of the girly mags not even being
          allowed on the top shelf would apply, and Mrs Whitehouse and
          the feminists could all shop there, and maybe pay a few pence
          extra for their sweeties and newspapers. It might even be
          that certain products (cigarettes being the obvious one)
          might be forbidden in these prudish, high-profit margin, low
          turnover places. Fine. If someone thinks he can make such
          places pay, let him try.</p>

          <p>Some streets would allow those allegedly
          tasteless and over-the-top Benetton ads, and others
          wouldn&#39;t. Which is exactly as it should be.</p>

          <p><b><font size="+1">A Market in Regulations</font></b></p>

          <p>The point I want to make very, very
          strongly here is that I am absolutely not against
          &quot;regulations&quot;. Those who say that &quot;there ought
          to be more regulations&quot; are right. But what there ought
          not to be is more government regulations. The nationalised
          regulation industry, in other words, should be
          denationalised. &quot;Deregulation&quot; is a most
          unfortunate slogan, I think.</p>

          <p>Regulation is a good thing. We all do it.
          Regulation ensures the regular delivery of milk bottles at
          the same time of the day, every day, rather than just at any
          old time, if you&#39;re lucky. Sony TV sets work every time,
          because Sony workers all have to abase themselves before
          great thick books, crammed with regulations. The Sunday Times
          puts all its job adverts in this massive supplement, but all
          the lonely hearts adverts (not too raunchy please) in that
          one, and so on. Regulations. Regulations. Regulations.</p>

          <p>The rest of us happily consume these
          regulations. We learn that this shop will only sell this kind
          of product, and hence only attract this kind of person, and
          will have this kind of promotional material on its walls. And
          if that&#39;s the kind of style we like, we go there. If not,
          we avoid the place and avoid being offended by it.</p>

          <p>Insofar as some shopping centres already
          are quasi-privately owned, we are already prefering them to
          the squalour of the public sector. All those lovely
          regulations that are allowed to flower in the private sector,
          about clean floors, and good air conditioning! Equally
          important is that the private sector enforces its
          regulations. Public sector regulations are thrashed out by
          the ton, but they then tend not to be enforced, because they
          are too silly or because nobody cares about them, or because
          the cost of someone caring would be even sillier than the
          regulations themselves.</p>

          <p>Perhaps the most potent argument of all
          against public sector regulation and in favour of private
          sector regulations is that private sector regulations which
          turn out to be ridiculous and unenforceable can be quietly
          &quot;repealed&quot;, without huge parliamentary
          convulsions.</p>

          <p><b><font size="+1">Truth</font></b></p>

          <p>One of the most sinister ideas of all
          coming from the enthusiasts for nationalised regulation is
          that the government - or its appointees - should be deciding
          what is true, that there should, in other words, be a
          Ministry of Truth. This despite the fact that the more
          completely a government dominates the society it governs, the
          bigger and the more outrageous the lies that government will
          itself tell.</p>

          <p>The way to discover the truth is ... to
          discover it. Let everyone propose what they think is true,
          and then let others say why the first bunch of people are
          wrong, and let the truth emerge from the debate, just as the
          best business enterprises only emerge after the institutional
          search process that is the free market. You can&#39;t have a
          proper debate about what is true unless the means of saying
          what is true are spread around in society at large, and
          unless you are allowed to be wrong.</p>

          <p>Many believe that the truth is obvious,
          and that there would thus be no problem about a law
          compelling people to be truthful. Lies, it is widely
          believed, are only spread by deliberate liars. But this is
          not so, a fine example of a non-obvious truth being that the
          truth is not always obvious! The way to handle truth in
          advertising is to treat truth as being like beauty, good
          taste or good manners, a matter of subjective opinion. In a
          free market, TV channels or street owners who cared about the
          truthfulness of the atmosphere they radiated would tend to
          refuse blatantly dishonest adverts, just as newspapers do
          now. In newspapers and magazines, the truth tends,
          eventually, to prevail over untruth, even though untruth is
          basically allowed. The same principle should apply in
          advertising. And it should be recognised by all adults that
          learning about the world and its potentially wicked ways
          includes learning that you shouldn&#39;t believe all you read
          in the advert. Caveat, in other words, emptor. In plain
          English: let the buyer beware.</p>

          <p>If you insist on being exposed only to
          truthful advertising, then purchase only those magazines,
          attend only to those electronic media, and visit only those
          public venues that make a point of vetting their adverts for
          truth content. Truth plc would be a perfectly acceptable
          enterprise to attempt to establish. There&#39;s obviously a
          living to made by people who are willing to judge adverts
          according to their truth content, and who get good enough at
          this dicey business to build reputations for good judgment.
          Once accepted by one of the known (but challengeable in the
          market by rival) arbiters of truth, then an advert would be
          acceptable anywhere. But if turned down by Truth plc (and by
          Truthmongers Incorporated, and by The Truth Fairies of
          California and by the Truthsayers League), an advertisement
          would only be allowed in places where the truth was for the
          customers to worry about. If you want to fuss a bit, but not
          that much, keep an eye open for the little supporting logos
          in the corner of adverts, supplied or witheld by the various
          truth arbiters.</p>

          <p><b><font size="+1">Legislation Leading to
          Lawlessness</font></b></p>

          <p>In this piece of writing I am trying to
          sell the idea of private property, the free market, and
          capitalism unrestrained by any rules except its own rules, to
          everyone. I am saying: in a free market, you&#39;ll get a lot
          of what you want, whoever you are. You won&#39;t get it all,
          because that would cost you too much, but you will get more
          of it if you let tradesmen supply it to you than if you rely
          on the government. And I&#39;m saying that this will apply
          just as much to the supply of Honesty and Good Taste in
          Advertising, as it will to the supply of fresh vegetables or
          washing machines.</p>

          <p>But some won&#39;t accept this
          dispensation, no matter what they personally get from it.
          These are the people who really do oppose the legality of
          other people&#39;s tastes. Even the thought of a tasteless or
          misleading advert, even if they never see it and are never
          directly affected by it, is offensive to these people. They
          want their tastes and opinions imposed on everyone, no matter
          what the cost may be to the rest of us, and they want to
          indulge in their own tastes at way below the market price for
          them, ditto.</p>

          <p>Well, if these people really and truly
          want a uniform world, where only their tastes and views
          apply, and in which other tastes are only indulged in on the
          black market, then I say to them: you can&#39;t have it. You
          think you are being virtuous and opposing wickedness. I think
          you are yourselves being wicked. Wicked because intolerant,
          and wicked because if you use the law to forbid things that
          millions of other people don&#39;t actually think is wrong,
          and won&#39;t help the police to stop, you will destroy the
          very law itself, as surely as you would destroy a china jug
          if you used it to hammer nails.</p>

          <p>Actually, you people are busily doing this
          already. You already do it with drugs and porn. Soon you will
          ban cigarettes, everywhere. Then you&#39;ll go for booze, and
          cars. You think you are good at making rules, and that I
          don&#39;t care about rules and prefer a permanent shambles in
          everything. Actually I care very much about rules. But I want
          them well made, by the people best placed to make them. And I
          want you to know that I consider your rules be an unruly
          shambles by comparison.</p>

          <p><b><font size="+1">An Instrument of Arbitrary
          Repression</font></b></p>

          <p>The up-yours method of persuasion can
          sometimes be quite effective, hence my willingness to use it
          in the previous paragraph. But let me end this piece in
          favour of a free market in regulations, and against
          nationalised regulations, with a few less confrontational
          points.</p>

          <p>What if all of you folks who worry about
          good taste in advertising pass a lot of laws forbidding
          adverts to be smutty or disgusting or full of lies? What if
          the House of Commons then appoints a joblot of the Great and
          Good to take care of the matter? And what if all these Great
          and Good persons decide instead that smutty and misleading
          adverts should be compulsory? And what if the politicians let
          them get away with it, because they don&#39;t give a damn,
          and because, on the quiet, they mostly prefer smut and lies
          themselves?</p>

          <p>Compulsorily truthful and tasteful persons
          may laugh, but is that not pretty much what did happen during
          the sixties, to the nationalised British television industry,
          when that nice Lord Reith was replaced as Governor of the BBC
          by the degenerate Hugh Greene, and the floodgates of filth
          and ungodliness were opened? That is certainly what the
          prudish tendency now says. If you fashion an instrument of
          arbitrary repression, never forget how things would be if
          someone used it against you.</p>

          <p>And what if the principle that the
          printing press itself may now be fussed over by the modern
          equivalent of sixteenth century bishops is re-established, in
          the form of the censorship of advertising? Where will that
          leave more obviously opinionated written proclamations such
          as this one? Might it not soon be considered tasteless to
          oppose, as I have, the legal obligation of advertisers to say
          only what the government says is true? Ideas, once accepted,
          spread. If laws are passed saying that only truthful and
          tasteful tea adverts are permitted, how long before some
          parliamentary dolt says that the same thing should apply to
          other kinds of published opinion?</p>

          <p>In the meantime, if you disagree with this
          piece of writing, you are perfectly free to concoct and mass
          produce your own rival piece of paper, explaining why. Long
          may that remain the rule.<br>
