First published 1982.

Political Notes editor Brian Micklethwait states, with the
help of leading American libertarian David Friedman, the
libertarian case, and invites contributions from others
willing to share in this task.

Regular readers of the literature put out by the Libertarian Alliance will have noticed that a significant part of this output
now takes the form of the single A4 sheet, free of charge,
hand-outs known as “Political Notes”.

This format has several advantages. Although not without labour, the production process of Political Notes is, compared to
the preparation of something like *Free Life* (the quarterly journal of the Libertarian Alliance) a doddle. Hence articles under
the Political Notes banner tend to get printed quicker, and can
thus be more topical.

Because Political Notes is relatively cheap to produce the LA
can afford to give copies of it away, which, without undue
waste, is what it does, mostly via a display at The Alternative
Bookshop.

Because of being given away, Political Notes reaches a far
more varied readership than *Free Life*, or other libertarian literature with a price tag on it. In particular, it is read by people
who, until they read it, know nothing whatever of the libertarian position, on anything.

## WHAT IS LIBERTARIANISM?

So, what if you are just such a reader, whose total knowledge
of the libertarian position consists of what you have learned
from reading this leaflet, this far? Other issues of Political
Notes have answered this question simply by reeling off page
one of the LA’s introductory leaflet, i.e. by writing out the following:

(1) the right of all persons to life, liberty and justly acquired
property;

(2) the voluntary exchange of all goods and services;

(3) each individual’s liberty to pursue his or her chosen lifestyle, but not to impose it forcibly on anyone else;

(4) elimination of coercive intervention by the state, the foremost violator of liberty.

If the above sentiments are interesting enough to you to make
you want to dig a bit deeper (assuming you haven’t done this
already), then one way would be to read my favorite introductory book on libertarianism: *[The Machinery Of Freedom: Guide To A Radical Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machinery_of_Freedom)*, by David Friedman.

Like all libertarians I tend to exaggerate the importance of the
particular route I took to being a libertarian, so because this
was the book that “converted” me, my admiration for it may be
excessive. But I really do think it very good. and this not just
because the bookshop I work in has the entire stock of it now
available outside the USA.

## NATURAL CONCLUSIONS

No David Friedman “industry” is likely to develop, whose industrialists take turns in saying what the great sage said, because you have only to read Friedman himself to find this out
with great ease. The preface to The Machinery Of Freedom
starts like this:

> My political views seem natural and obvious to me. Others
find them peculiar. Their peculiarity consists largely of
carrying certain statements, familiar enough in political
oratory, to their natural conclusions.
>
> I believe, as many say they believe, that everyone has the
right to run his own life — to go to hell in his own
fashion. I conclude, as do many on the left, that all censorship should be done away with. Also that all laws
against drugs — marijuana, heroin, or Dr. Quack’s cancer
cure — should be repealed. Also laws requiring cars to
have seat belts.
>
> The right to control my life does not mean the right to
have anything I want free; I can do that only by making
someone else pay for what I get. Like any good right
winger, I oppose welfare programs that support the poor
with money taken by force from the taxpayers.
>
> I also oppose tariffs, subsidies, loan guarantees, urban
renewal, agricultural price supports — in short, all of the
much more numerous programs that support the not-poor
— often the rich — with money taken by force from the
taxpayers — often the poor.

## A VIRTUOUS SOCIETY

Friedman summarises the libertarian case like this:

> The central idea of libertarianism is that people should be
permitted to run their own lives as they wish. We totally
reject the idea that people must be forcibly protected from
themselves.

And a little further on:

> People who wished to aid others would do so voluntarily
through private charity, instead of using money collected
by force from the taxpayers. People who wished to provide
for their old age would do so through private insurance.
>
> People who wish to live in a “virtuous” society, surrounded by others who share their ideas of virtue, would
be free to set up their own communities and to contract
with each other so as to prevent the “sinful” from buying
or renting within them. Those who wished to live communally could set up their own communes. But nobody
would have the right to force his way of life upon his
neighbor.

And so on. Friedman’s next chapter is called “In Defense of
Property”.

As you can probably tell from such phrases as “urban renewal”, David Friedman is an American who writes “in American”.
The conclusion will be drawn from this fact by some British
readers that libertarianism is an exclusively American notion,
of no relevance to us and our problems. Naturally we in the
Libertarian Alliance do not believe this, and we are busy creating our own body of literature written “in English”, full of
references to the GLC, Bruce Forsyth, helmetless football, and
so on.

Political Notes is part of this enterprise.

## WHAT’S IN A NAME?

Regular readers of Political Notes are entitled to suspect that if
a writer’s Christian name is “Brian” his chances of getting
something printed in Political Notes are somewhat increased,
and that if in addition his surname is “Micklethwait” success is
a virtual certainty. On the other hand, would-be scribes will
fear, to score nought out of two in this test guarantees failure.
The revelation that Brian Micklethwait is the present editor of
Political Notes will cause little amazement, if any.

The above circumstance is beginning to change. Brian Micklethwait may be the editorial supremo of Political Notes, but
the Libertarian Alliance also contains vested interests like Chris
Tame (Secretary), Tony Hollick (*Free Life* editor), various directors, advisers, and so on, all of whom must be placated.
From time to time members even express their views. The
point has been reached where the name “Brian Micklethwait”
as a Political Notes writer is almost a liability. Accordingly,
other writers must now have their work published in Political
Notes, if only so that Brian Micklethwait can continue to write
for Political Notes without incurring further hostility in the
upper reaches of the LA.

So if you have something to say that is related to libertarianism, and in particular something that persuasively applies libertarian principles to some special topic of interest to you, send it
in.

## GUIDANCE

Try to fill what you consider to be gaps in the LA output.
There have been recent LA articles about Poland, Russia and
the Lebanon, and America is an inevitable libertarian obsession. But there hasn’t been anything I can recall on South
Africa, Hong Kong or Guinea Bissau. Children have been
much discussed, but old people not, and so on.

Past issues of Political Notes have dealt, among other things,
with anarchy, democracy, unemployment and schools. Future
issues are “planned” (i.e. I promise nothing, except some more
issues) dealing with transport, broadcasting, libertarian tactics,
and democracy (again).

You could even say why you think libertarianism is nonsense,
provided you leave some space for me or someone to say why
we think you are wrong.

Study a previous copy of Political Notes, and ensure that your
piece will fit in the same space. Try to leave room for eye
catching graphics. Better still, supply some with your article.
I like doing photo-reductions of newspapers, but am not obsessed with this technique. Photo-reduction is cheap, but colour is right out.

By all means be topical, but don’t assume knowledge of any
supposedly public events you may choose to discuss. We want
to keep Political Notes in print, so it must make sense to English readers anywhere on earth, in 1997.

Above all, remember that (see the heading above) you are
preaching to the unconverted. Do *not* assume knowledge of
the libertarian position, and feel entirely free to burden hardened libertarians with yet another summary of libertarianism, just
as I have done in this piece.

However, do not bully the reader with nags to the effect that he
is either a libertarian of exactly our type or a worm. Distinguish between telling him what libertarians think and telling
him that he also should think that. The “libertarians believe”
(“socialists reject”, “Christians proclaim” etc.) technique is a
good one, because it lets the reader stand outside the debate,
while still learning what it consists of. He can take sides if he
wants to, but need not. Remember, ideas are often spread by
those who profoundly disagree with them, but who understand
what they are and describe them accurately to others.

Apart from writing something relevant to libertarianism, the
main rule is: write well. For my understanding of what that
means see George Orwell’s classic essay “[Politics and The English Language](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/)”. Or, if digging up ancient masterpieces annoys you, write the way you wish you could talk, and the way
you like others to talk to you.

## DEBATES

*Free Life*, I am reminded, also welcomes further articles,
whether on new topics, or in the form of comments on articles
already printed or debates already in progress.
We have lots of debates. Libertarianism is not a wall-chart
from which the correct opinion about any issue can be quickly
discovered.

Here’s another David Friedman quote a lot of us are fond of:

> Somewhere in the world there may be two libertarians
who agree with each other about everything, but I am not
one of them.

The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to Radical Capitalism, David Friedman

The libertarian case for freedom
is no longer unfamiliar. But
David Friedman picks up where
the others leave off, in two major
respects.

His case for private property is
fresh
He dares to go beyond attractive
theory to offer arresting,, workable ways to “sell the State” in
small pieces.”
He demolishes the standard liberal arguments for the mixed
economy, again offering new insights. After reading Dr. Friedman, no respectable liberal will
ever again urge “human rights,
not property rights” without feeling uneasy. As for “public
property managed for the public
good,” Dr. Friedman exposes the
reression lurking in a formula
most people take for granted.

But David Friedman doesn’t stop
at theory. The book abounds
with practical ideas for getting
rid of the big-government mess.
The social problems are real:
schools,
pollution, mass transit, many
more. The author doesn’t simply
say individuals can handle them
better. He shows us how.
