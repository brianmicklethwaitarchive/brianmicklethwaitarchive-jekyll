Build the web site:

python3 generate_quotes.py [title of article for first quote] > _includes/generated_quotes.html
export PATH=$PATH:~/.gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin # probably that version number will change
bundle exec jekyll serve

Test the web site.

Then look in ../firebase/README to see how to deploy.
