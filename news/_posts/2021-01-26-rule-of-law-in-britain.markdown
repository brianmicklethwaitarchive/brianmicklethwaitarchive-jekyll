We will be slowly adding more pamphlets. In 1994 the [rule of law](/la/legan021.html)
was already under attack from a generation of sub-Marxists from the
early seventies who assumed it was about nobs vs yobs, and Joe Public
who wanted new laws to prevent tragedy.

> The end result of this pandemic of lawmaking and regulating is going to be the exact disaster that the sub-Marxists had said was already the case, a legal system which is nothing but an instrument of class warfare. The dominant class will be whichever class has captured the government, and the victims of the process will be whatever minorities that this governing class happens to have taken a dislike to. We will finally have a legal system that sends people to prison for, in the words of an old TV sketch, Looking At Me In A Funny Way.
