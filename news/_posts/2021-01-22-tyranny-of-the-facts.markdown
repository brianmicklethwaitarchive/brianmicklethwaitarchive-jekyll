We will be slowly adding more pamphlets. Today, by special request of
Patrick Crozier, we have Libertarian Alliance
[tactical note number 7](/la/tacn007.html) which contains advice on how not
to lose arguments by relying on facts, or conceding that specific facts
necessitate specific actions.

Tyranny of the Facts.
