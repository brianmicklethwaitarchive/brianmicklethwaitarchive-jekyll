title: Getting To The Political Parties

When you take sides in arguments those already in them tend
to listen to you. There is now a faction of the Federation of
Conservative Students called the “libbies”. The centrist, pro-Heath FCS faction is now cooperating with the far-right National Socialist faction of FCS (the nickname for which I will
spare you) against these libbies.

And it really is libertarianism that is spreading, rather than
some horrendous caricature of it. The centrists and National
Socialists denounce the libbies for believing something genuinely libertarian, and the libbies then do some reading to find
out what they’re accused of. There has been quite a change.
Not long ago, self-proclaimed “libertarian” sympathisers were
lining up with other “right-wingers” to demand, say, tighter immigration controls. Now the libbies are as opposed to the
“loony right” as they are to the centrists, and are reading books
that tell them why.

I was once a student at Essex University, and the venomous
way these libbies talk about Edward Heath reminds me of the
way that “hard left” (as they are now called) students used to
talk about Wilson, Brown, Jenkins and Co, and has to be heard
to be believed. (“Hard line” libertarians, they call themselves.)
Think what those hard left students subsequently did to the entire Labour Party in the years since. I haven’t attended any of
these FCS gatherings, but anyone concerned about the unity of
the Conservative Party during the next twenty years ought,
from what I hear, to be alarmed. The faction fighting in FCS is
already beginning to spread outwards to the constituencies, just
as it did in the Labour Party.

I suppose Conservative students have to quarrel about something, and so for them to be quarrelling about libertarianism is
success, of a kind, for us. It would be an even greater success,
for us if they could simply discuss libertarianism, without all
the unpleasantness, but maybe that’s asking too much.

Meanwhile, disunity among their enemies could be a way back
to power for the British left. Libertarians aren’t the only ones
now insisting on the differences between Conservatism and
libertarianism, as anyone who’s been reading the *New Statesman* lately will know.

One of the organisations now spreading an understanding of
libertarian ideas within the Conservative Party is the deeply
distrusted “Tory Reform Group” (based at deeply distrusted 9
Poland Street), whose tiny membership, widely regarded as
leftist plants, are kite-flying a campaign to unite Conservative
Party centrists and neo-fascists against the “menace of libertarianism”.

You can’t combat a menace without describing it, and inevitably some have preferred this menace to the ideas of those
complaining about it.

So, we have a major political party, some of whose members
are attracted by our ideas, even though these ideas are emphatically not a total endorsement of the party’s broad policy package. The flames of factionalism crackle, whereupon enemies
of the party show up, brandishing fans.

Next question: could a similar process be made to happen
within any of the other political parties? Our Conservative
sympathisers react with horror to the thought. No chance!
Corporatists! Socialists! It would be mere talk!! But “mere
talk” is very important. Why else would we bother with the
Conservative Party? Could it be that libertarian sympathisers
in the Conservative Party, who have already embarked on
careers of political activism, are afraid that they might have
placed the wrong bets, and that they might have picked other
less obvious but in the long run more advantageous political
niches in which to advance their careers?

# SDP IEA LINK

During the last few decades, the most effective organisation in
Britain promoting free market ideas has been the Institute of
Economic Affairs, the two leading spirits of which have been
Ralph (now Lord) Harris, and Arthur Seldon. Seldon has recently been socialising with SDP leader David Owen, and an
article by Owen is the lead (headlined on the front cover) in
issue number 1 of *Economic Affairs* (released October 24th
1983), which is the revamped successor to the IEA’s *Journal of Economic Affairs*. Another recent IEA publication
was *Agenda For Social Democracy*. IEA regulars had heard most of it before and were disappointed, but seen through SDP spectacles it
packs more punch. Seldon also wrote a plug for the SDP
(topped by photos of the Gang of Four) in *Reason*, a widely
distributed American libertarian magazine. Can it then be coincidence that in among his more statist utterances recently,
Owen has included some pro free market thoughts?

Imagine the effect of this on some SDP activist in the provinces, rung up by the local paper and asked to “comment”.
“Well” (gulp) “I think these are very interesting ideas, that
deserve to be, er, discussed. I think David Owen has a point
here.” Etcetera. This from a person whose every public utterance until now has included denunciations of Thatcherite extremism. Soon he too will be hastily flicking through books, to
find out what he’s said.

And what of the Liberals? Yes, says David Steel, they too
have “always” supported the free market. True, the idea hasn’t
been much discussed by liberals in recent years, but that is because
it is “taken for granted” by them. The eagerness with
which Tony Benn has lately been canvassing for the support of
Liberal “community politicians” in the columns of *The Guardian*, suggests otherwise, for the Liberal Party is not what it was
before Lloyd George got hold of it. The SDP is a better libertarian bet.

Anarchist LA member David Botsford was for a time a member of the SDP, and he informs me that, as in many Conservative circles, “politics” is not a subject members are encouraged
to discuss, for this might damage party unity. The thing is to
build up membership! Only the SDP’s leaders, it seems, may
discuss policy issues. But sooner or later political arguments
are bound to break out among mere members, and may even
now be resulting in samizdat literature.

In the SDP, just as in the Conservative Party, there exists a
ready market for anti-socialist ideas of any kind, for the appallingness of the hard left is part of SDP folklore. It’s what made
them start their party in the first place. Libertarian ideas may
(some of them) please Mrs Thatcher, but on the other hand
they do have a gratifyingly apoplectic effect on leftists, so
ideas loosely describable as libertarian are bound to surface in
SDP arguments, without automatically being denounced, and
become ammunition in SDP faction fights. And again, as with
the Conservatives, the hard left will then use their various SDP
moles and fronts to try to exacerbate these differences.

# SAY IT AND DO IT

The free market is not the only rhetorical wave of the immediate future, but it is certainly one of them, and the SDP’s best
strategy will be to use this fact, not fight it. We already have a
mixed economy, so there is no need to believe in it, and every
reason not to. What the SDP should do is hurl the free market
verbiage of the Conservatives back in their faces.

What about all those fatcat landowners in the cabinet, guzzling
farm subsidies? What of all the lawyers on the Conservative
back benches, running the tightest state enforced closed shop
there is, and of the upper-class unions and their restrictive practices generally? What of the protectionist manoevres indulged
in by the big corporations that pay the Conservatives’ election
expenses? The only reason the Conservatives haven’t been
embarrassed this way long ago is that no mainstream politician
has tried it.

There is nothing intrinsically upper-class about libertarianism.
Of all people, the poor gain most from freedom and from the
economic institutions that result from it, because competing
employers bid up the price of labour, and competing tradesmen
bid down the price of goods for the resulting mass market. It
is the capitalist countries of the would-be developing world
which have done best for their poor people, not the collectivist
ones.

Nor need the egalitarian urges of the SDP be outraged by the
entertainment of libertarian ideas. If there existed now, or had
ever existed, any state-dominated society with more equality
between members of it than occurs in the free market, then the
libertarian belief that equality is not even desirable would be a
problem for the SDP. As it is the question is hypothetical, like
the one about whether freedom is better than prosperity, or vice
versa (the reality being that the choice is between both or
neither.)

It is precisely the radicalism of “laissez-faire ideology” that
makes shrewder Conservative strategists so wary of it, and so
likely to resist any attempt by the present government to take it
seriously during the next few years.

The absence of any intellectual tradition behind the SDP has its
advantages. The last thing the Labour Party wants is to compare the reality of the Thatcher government with its free market
rhetoric. For ideas are like muscles; when you use them you
strengthen them. (The Labour version of events is that the
Thatcher government is the result of free market rhetoric.) But
the SDP need not worry about strengthening the free market
case. It should attack the present government by saying: they
talk about the free market, but we’ll do it. Conservative
rhetoric has its virtues, but the reality of the Conservative Party
makes it incapable of living up this rhetoric. We’ll do something they’ll never do; we’ll apply the free market to them!

The SDP argument is not so much that the ideas of the Conservative and Labour Parties are wrong, as that they are both class
based rather than national parties. Although all manner of
people vote Labour and vote Conservative, the money comes
from the big unions and big business. The two major parties
are, so to speak, wondrously successful pressure groups, which
have succeeded in presenting their own special interests as the
“national interest”.

# SPREAD OF IDEAS BUT NOT TRIUMPH

Libertarians cannot be so optimistic about the SDP itself, for it
too is a political party, and if it succeeds in digging itself in for
the long fight, it too will attach itself to a particular social milieu and push for the interests of those who inhabit it. The
SDP hopes to take only the good ideas from Labour and from
the Conservatives, but is just as likely to take bad ones.

Consider democracy. Democracy is a wondrously effective
way of wrecking an organisation, so naturally the Conservative
and Labour Parties want to inflict it on their enemies, the
unions and big business respectively. The Labour Party being
the Labour Party, they also want to inflict it on each other. (If
democracy did any good, people would do it to themselves and
their friends, not their enemies.) With luck each group will
swap inaction on each front for inaction on the others, and
British society will, if it knows what’s good for it, heave a sigh
of relief. But the SDP wants to democratise everybody and
everything.

But this leaflet is about the spreading of libertarian ideas, not
their triumph. So long as our ideas are understood, and taken
seriously even by those who utterly disagree with them, then
for the moment we’ll be content.

# NO LIBERTARIAN PARTY

None of the above scenarios of intellectual cross-fertilisation
would be happening so easily if the libertarian movement in
Britain ever became the Libertarian Party.

US libertarian Richard Wilcke, of the Council for a Competitive Economy, writing in response to Political Notes 5 (*Liberty Versus Democracy*), reports that the existence of the US Libertarian Party actually interrupts the spread of libertarian ideas.
What happens is that some mainstream politician makes a few
vaguely libertarian noises, but instead of welcoming this development and sending polite letters enclosing pamphlets, LP officials react with fury. *How dare this man steal our votes*.

Libertarians ought not to be fussing about votes, and as for
people stealing libertarian ideas, well, that’s one of the ideas.
We want the Conservatives, the SDP, and, yes, Labour and the
Liberals, to steal our ideas and embarrass each other with them.
That won’t happen if we insist that we alone are capable of
wise thoughts.

Wilcke advises us not to form a Libertarian Party here, and we
weren’t intending to. His letter suggests rather that if someone
else ever does this, we ought to do everything to blow the
operation out of the water, with, perhaps, well timed leaflets
about the laws against heroin. (We oppose the laws against
heroin.)

The full text of Wilcke’s letter is, I’m told, to be published in a
future issue of Free Life, the quarterly journal of the Libertarian Alliance.
