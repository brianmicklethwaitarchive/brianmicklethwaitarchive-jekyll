We are adding more pamphlets. [Libertarian Alliance Pamphlet 6](/la/lapam006.html) is a report sent to the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health and the British Medical Association. It argues that it
is important to defend the freedom of smokers and of people in the tobacco trade.

> We who value freedom first, and tobacco second or less or not at all, must be ready to argue for freedom for smokers and for tobacco traders as for everyone else.

It makes the case that partaking of smoking is a matter of self-ownership, that advertising cigarrettes is a matter of freedom of speech, and that trade in tobacco is a matter of the voluntary acts of free people.
