Brian Micklethwait.

First published 2002

In 1998 I wrote and the Libertarian Alliance published a piece
about the teaching of literacy, praising phonics and trashing lookand-say methods ([Political Notes No. 29](educn029.html), *On the Harm Done by
“Look-and-Say”: A Reaction to Bonnie MacMillan’s Why Schoolchildren Can’t Read*). I expressed support for any campaigns that
anyone might be running along such lines, and a pro-phonics group
called the Reading Reform Foundation got in touch and have sent
me issues number 45, 46 and 47 of their *Newsletter*.

As is appropriate, given what the Reading Reform Foundation
stands for, there is in these newsletters a satisfyingly bland emphasis on pertinent information conveyed in clear English, and an
absence of frantic illustrative enlivenment such as the look-and-say people feel the constant need for. Other than a few graphs and
tables, and a couple of illustrations of what children’s work looks
like when it’s being done well, it’s all text. And the story told by
the text is of a campaign whose members convince me that they
know what they are doing and who are doing some good, which is
more than you can say for some “campaigners”. These people
know how to teach children to read and write, and are busily telling others both about all the evidence for this claim, and about
how others can also teach children successfully.

## CRACKING THE LITERACY CODE

The doctrine which the Reading Reform Foundation is battling
against – “look-and-say” – says that children learn by looking at
entire words, or by looking at the first letter and then looking at an
accompanying picture. You don’t read. You guess.

This doctrine has been a disaster. It has now created several generations of illiterate, “dyslexic” and, in general, badly educated
people. The majority of those subjected to this great folly have
muddled through, their lives temporarily disrupted but not permanently blighted, or not too badly. They have “cracked” reading, in
the manner of Bletchley Park codebreakers. They have “got” the
logic of reading despite having had to work it out for themselves.
Other lucky people have been remedially taught by their parents in
the correct way. But an appallingly large number, especially those
without well-educated parents, have not been so lucky. Worse,
many of the incompetents who were mistaught this way are now
starting seriously to infest the teaching profession itself, there to
perpetuate their own confusions. And of course many non-recovered look-and-sayers are now parents, unable to rescue their
children from the mess created by their children’s teachers, because
that mess is all that they themselves now know.

## “ANALYTIC” VERSUS “SYNTHETIC” PHONICS

Aside from the importance of phonics and the basic wrongness of
look-and-say, the technical matter that the Reading Research Foundation most insists upon is the difference between, as they call it,
“analytic” phonics and “synthetic” phonics.

Analytic phonics means taking words, and breaking them down
into separate letters and noises. To begin teaching reading and
writing to children by doing this is apparently not helpful. It
doesn’t do much harm, but neither does it do much good.

The synthetic phonics approach begins with the separate letters, introduced one at a time, writing each letter – both upper and lower
case, naming each letter, and identifying the sound made by each
letter. (These last two – the name we call the letter A by, and the
sound made by the letter A – are two distinct matters, and not
obviously so. Many unfortunates now spend their entire lives not
understanding even this basic and crucial distinction.) Pupils are
then lead towards assembling letters, and the sounds that the letters
together make, into words. This works.

You start with easy letters and sounds where there’s no ambiguity,
and later you learn the tricky stuff with which the English language
especially is so afflicted. You decypher the sound of a word by
reading it from beginning to end, rather than merely by noting the
first letter and then guessing. You don’t guess. You read.

A parallel between teaching reading and writing, and teaching
something like the violin, springs to mind. You don’t start playing
the violin by analysing “real” pieces of music, with all their associated complexities. As a beginner violinist, you start by playing
individual notes, starting with the easiest ones, and you play very
easy tunes composed and chosen for their easiness rather than their
musical profundity. Only much later do you attempt the Beethoven
Violin Concerto.

## PERPETUATING FOLLY

Look and say is, thanks to people like those active in the RRF, on
the retreat. But since this retreat is being conducted by politicians,
and by advisers many of whom created the mess now being retreated from, it is not surprising that the story here is not so encouraging.

In that piece I wrote in 1998 I reported that the present Labour
Government has been persuaded of the merits of phonics. Well,
individual bits, such as the then Education Minister David Blunkett, may have been, somewhat. But the dominant doctrine at the
Department for Education and Science remains more than somewhat look-and-say in its overall approach.

Reading between the lines of what the RRF reports, what seems to
be happening is as follows. The phonics-persons have pretty much
proved their case, probably even in the eyes of many of the look-and-say people. But the look-and-say “experts” at the DfES are in
an arkward position. (The inverted commas around “experts”
being there because these people don’t know things which are true,
they “know” things which are untrue.) Suppose their bad techniques are completely swept away and completely replaced by
completely good ones. The teaching of literacy in schools would
leap forward. A mass of seemingly “complex” problems, like the
recent huge rise in “dyslexia”, the spiralling cost of “special needs”
education, and the general inability of several generations of people
to learn how to spell, will be revealed as not so complex after all.
These problems will be revealed to all as having been caused by
the government’s own literacy “experts”. Thus it is that even –
especially – those “experts” who have been completely convinced
of the wrongness of their own former opinions now face a huge,
career-saving incentive to perpetuate their follies as much as they
can, to disguise the enormity of the disaster they have caused.

That’s what they’ve done. The recently launched “National Literacy Strategy” is still heavily polluted with the wrong methods.
The teaching of reading and writing is now said to require a “mixture” of phonic and other methods, and is accordingly going to
have – is already having – exactly the rather disappointing results
that the RRF has been anxiously predicting.

It gets worse. The National Literacy Strategy is being touted by
many of those who support it as “phonics in action”, and as those
disappointing results duly materialise, this disappointment is going
to be held up as proof that “this is a complex issue”, and that
“there are no panaceas”. There is no “absolutely right way” to
teach literacy, and teachers must all just blunder on much as they
always have, “guided” by the government in ways that will remain
for a long time deeply flawed.

## POLITICAL STREETFIGHTING

Sadly, this political aspect of the schools literacy mess is not one
that the RRF people convince me that they now know how to correct.

These phonics-persons seem to have followed the usual procedure
followed by people who know more about their own speciality
than they do about politics. They have assembled their unanswerable case for the nationalised industry with which they are concerning themselves to stop doing things badly and to start doing things
well. The politicians and bureaucrats have had meetings with the
phonics-persons, and have nodded encouragingly. And then the
politicians and bureaucrats have screwed the phonics-persons.

The phonics-persons are now, I surmise, resorting to trying to “persuade public opinion” to do to the politicians what they, the
phonics-persons, could not do, namely beat some sense into them.
Hence, I further surmise, the somewhat improved state of their propaganda machine and their willingness and ability to communicate
a little more effectively with people such as me, who can supply
them with further iotas of “public” support.

But if the RRF are serious about persuading the politicians and the
bureaucrats to change their ways, they need to start naming the
names of supporters and opponents and itemising speeches and
parliamentary statements, if not to all of us in their newsletters and
press releases, then at least to themselves, in their private databases. They need a detailed model of victory, and a detailed plan
for getting victory.

They need to know which anti-phonics “experts” and enthusiasts
are three-quarters persuaded of the case against what they’ve been
doing and are wanting now to move things quickly in the right
direction. They need to be super-nice to such persons, to be sympathetic for their former enthusiasm, to trumpet support for their
obvious goodwill, and to go to their book launches, dinner parties
and weddings.

And they need to know which important and enthusiastic antiphonics “experts” and power-brokers are unbudgeable and to make
life hell for them to the point where, although never persuaded,
they give up. They must attack such persons not only in RRF publications but on other fronts (like their own university departments,
their own constituencies, their own trade union memberships), by
isolating them from former supporters, by bullying them with surprise planted questions into making public concessions to sanity
and then quoting these concessions back at them and to the entire
universe from then on, and by publicising the fact (and I bet it is a
fact) that many of these “experts” prefer the best sort of phonics
methods when it comes to the education of their own children.

But the RRF people seem mostly to be nice lady schoolteachers,
not political streetfighters. Do they have the skills for this kind of
operation, or even know anyone who does? Could they afford him
if they did? I know someone exactly like this, and he will already
have recognised a few of his methods being alluded to in the previous two paragraphs and himself in this sentence. He in his turn
knows many more such operators. But these people don’t come
cheap and are hard for the untrained eye to distinguish from conmen.

If the RRF don’t have the stomach for such political battling, then
frankly I don’t blame them. When people tell me that I ought to
be “fighting” for libertarianism by such methods I mutter to myself
such things as: “Why don’t you, if you’re so keen on all this
stuff?”

## WHY DID THE ANGLOSPHERE DO SO BADLY?

One of the most interesting ideas I got from reading the RRF
newsletters concerned the relative difficulty of English compared to
many other languages.

Not every person, certainly not every English person, likes German. All those harsh consonants banging and rasping away. All
that mucus flying about. It’s an old English claim, only semi-jocular, that no matter what a German is actually talking about it
sounds as if he is invading Poland. Maybe so, but not even the
most rabid Anglo can deny that knowing what a word sounds like
if all you have is the word written out in front of you, or knowing
how to spell a word if you only know how it sounds, is a whole lot
easier in German than in English.

In her review in RRF *Newsletter* 45 (on page 10) of an article in *The European Journal of the Psychology of Education*, Jennifer
Chew writes as follows:

> [The author] notes, too, that even with good phonics teaching,
the complexity of English letter-sound correspondences makes
decoding harder for English children than for German children, but suggests that systematic phonics teaching is all the
more important in English, as children are less likely to crack
the code by themselves.

When I read this sentence a mass of hitherto mysterious matters
suddenly snapped into focus.

For me, one of the great puzzles of the look-and-say disaster has
been why on earth this disaster has been so particularly disastrous
in the English speaking world, and so much less disastrous elsewhere. As an Englishman, I am not attracted by the idea that we
Anglos are just plain dumber than folks in other parts of the world,
yet the look-and-say story seems to suggest that overwhelmingly.
What other explanation is there for what’s been going on?

The answer, I think, is to be found in the effect that the complexities of English spelling have had both on the disposition of people
to accept the look-and-say method in the first place, and on the
relative amounts of damage that this method does depending on
which language is being taught.

In the Anglosphere, a powerful argument for look-and-say was that
since English spelling is so damned arbitrary, why don’t we stop
bothering with phonics and just go with the “whole word”? Or to
put it even more bluntly: since teaching English is so hard, why
don’t we just give up? This is a grotesque mistake, but it is an
easier mistake – a more tempting mistake – to make in England
than in Germany.

In German, there are virtually no ambiguities like those that so
abound in English spelling, so in Germany, letter-to-sound teaching
makes perfect sense and is easier to do. So, in Germany, on the
whole, they have carried right on with it, and in general, look-and-say caught on less strongly in most countries outside the Anglosphere but with the same alphabet as ours, blessed as these
countries mostly are with less confusing spelling systems than ours.
(I remember going on a bicycling trip to Finland as a teenager, and
being amazed that I could pronounce all Finnish place names correctly, without any exceptions, by simply reading them off the
signposts and following the rules. Try doing that in England!)

But even if look-and-say had caught on with equal severity in all
countries, it would still have done more damage to the teaching of
English than to the teaching of other languages, as the Jennifer
Chew quote above explains. For look-and-say to work, its hapless
victims have to “get” or “crack” the system they are pitted against,
and in English this system is much more difficult to crack, smothered as it is in so many contradictory signals – in so much
“noise”, as the information theorists would say. A look-and-say
German child is far more likely to “get” how to read German, even
if he is not given any more help in this than his wretched counterpart in England, and once he does there are far fewer exceptions to
the rules for him to worry about or be humiliated by. (How much
“dyslexia” do they have in Germany? I don’t know, but my guess
would be: less than in England.)

## COMPELLED/PERSUADED/ALLOWED

So, if official language teaching in the Anglosphere is likely to
remain a big problem for a long time, and if the RRF are no good
at politics anyway, what is to be done? What, in particular, should
the RRF do? What will they do?

The answer is that they are being steered, by the relative failure of
their politicking, and the more modest but still very tangible successes they are already achieving by other means, towards a
strategy which, luckily for them, will have more long-term beneficial impact than politicking, no matter how good at politicking they
might have been if they’d been different sorts of people to the nice
people that they are.

Once again, what they are doing is something that doesn’t come
completely naturally to them. At least when it comes to children,
these people are natural authoritarians. Nice, but firm.

They prefer “whole class” teaching to individualised one-to-one
teaching. After all, if there is a one best way to learn reading and
writing, why confine the news to just one child at a time? Teach a
whole class at once and achieve economies of scale, for heaven’s
sake. Their general attitude of there’s-a-right-way-and-there’s-a-wrong-way predisposes the RRF to take compulsion for granted.
Parents should simply be told what works best, which in any case
is what most of them are begging to be told, so compulsion isn’t a
problem with them. On the contrary, by simply banging on about
the right of parents to choose, the desired result is achieved.

And children should simply have what works shoved in front of
them, regardless of any inclinations that they might have – a procedure endorsed by most parents. The RRF people are fascinated –
quite reasonably – by their own field of expertise and relatively
indifferent to any broader concerns about their tactical methods
that might spring from a broader interest in political philosophy.
As with so many enthusiasts for a particular technique, the starting
question was simply: “What should people be compelled/persuaded/allowed to do?”, with no huge distinction being made between
compelling, persuading and allowing. If in practice they find
themselves arguing that children should be compelled to do the
right thing, that’s fine by them.

Now, however, the compulsion sector of the educational economy,
the State education system, is letting the good ladies of the RRF
down, as it lets most people down, and, almost despite themselves,
the RRF are being drawn towards the voluntary sector, the sector
where people get truly to choose what they’re going to do.

And a good thing too. So far I’ve been taking it for granted that
the RRF people are entirely right about literacy teaching. They
have certainly convinced me. But what if they are wrong? What
if I have been conned by them? What if all their talk of “synthetic” phonics is the kind of obsessional irrelevance that “experts”
so often indulge in to keep the masses dependent upon the continuing expert guidance of the RRF? Or what if the RRF people are
right in lots of ways, but wrong in others, such as in many of the
details of how to apply their basically right ideas? What if the
RRF are right about everything, except that, when you meet them,
they turn out to be annoying and unpersuasive people, whose main
impact will be to discredit rather than spread their own good ideas?

Nationalised industries bring out the worst in all experts, however
genuinely expert they may have been when they started out. The
financing of anything by politicians is always erratic and chaos-inducing. And even basically sound ideas degenerate into a barbaric
shambles through being forced upon people who don’t share them
and who then go out of their way to make them fail. “Best practice” is identified, perhaps correctly, in one place. But it is then
imperfectly described, and this imperfect description then becomes
the basis of disastrous national diktats. All of which could happen
if the RRF ladies – or people like them – were to dethrone and
replace the “experts” whom they are now battling against. No, the
free society is the right place for them to win their victory, if victory it is to be.

## THE NEW AGE OF FUN

But, the sting in the tail of the free society, from the RRF point of
view is that in it, it isn’t now just parents and teachers who get to
choose which teaching methods to use or which books to buy for
their children; the children themselves are now starting to take control of things. The “voluntary” sector, the free society, is itself now
moving inexorably towards the “freedom for children” paradigm.
The RRF people, whose natural inclication may very well be to
boss the children around – for their own good, naturally – are now
opening themselves up to being bossed by the children.

The reason for this is computers, and information technology
generally. In the good-old bad-old days, when pyramidic megacorporations, huge government departments, huge monolithic armies and patriarchal families all basically worked, they worked
because the people at the top controlled the flow of scarce information.

But now we live in an age of television screens and computers in
every room, and even if your particular workplace or family
doesn’t quite operate like this yet, it soon will and we all know it.
In such a world, the flow of information from the outside world to
underlings of all kinds – employees, footsoldiers, children – can no
longer be controlled by the bosses, the generals, or the teachers or
the parents.

Which is all part of why people like the RRF ladies disapprove of
computers. Computers are anarchy. Computers, just like televisions before them, are the dawning of the Age of Fun and the end
of the Age of Hard Work.

The underlying work ethic of the RRF ladies and of millions like
them is: No Pain No Gain. The ruling “work ethic”, if you can fall
it that, followed by the global information industry is: Gain. Gain
now. Gain pure and simple.

It’s not that the “no pain no gain” is fundamentally wrong. If it is
interpreted merely as a kind of Sod’s Law of the Inevitable Complexity of Stuff, then fine. It’s often true. Even with computers.
(In fact especially with computers!) But what “no pain no gain”
can no longer be allowed to excuse is the deliberate imposition of
pain, on the grounds that since Stuff is Sometimes Painful, you
have to get used to that by suffering this particular pain, which I
am deliberately imposing upon you, now. Teachers who demand
that children “concentrate”, on whatever they, the teachers, want
the children to concentrate on, may not now be teaching concentration. They may merely be interrupting the reality of it, and instead
be teaching children to hate what their teachers call “concentration” and thus to identify concentration – the real thing – as their
enemy. Disastrous.

In the days when what the teachers were teaching was the only
thing there was to concentrate on, this distinction didn’t matter.
You learned to concentrate, by concentrating on *this*. But in a
world where there are a million things to pay attention to, no particular teaching rigmarole should be *demanding* attention. It must
coax it, seduce it, persuade it. And when it fails to attract attention
it must take it on the chin and wait its turn. It must behave like
TV. (And don’t the no-pain-no-gain teachers just *hate* television,
for that exact reasons.)

The great cultural triumph of the computing industry is that, unlike
conventional schooling, it is now drawing attention away, by
purely voluntary means, from television.

Conventional teaching *demands* attention, and from some it gets it.
Television seduces attention, and from the masses it has got it, but
at a terrible price, that price being that the masses don’t learn anything. That’s an extremely debatable claim, but as a one sentence
summary of the educational impact of television it is truer than
most rivals. You don’t learn anything from television, because
when you watch television you don’t do anything. So if you have
any sense of your own interests you do eventually wrench yourself
away from the telly and get yourself a life. This trade-off is now
embedded deep in our culture.

Computers are now slowly squaring the circle. When you use a
computer, you learn, because you interact with it. You yourself do
things, and thus you *learn* to do things. Computers, by the sheer
logic of the free society, are, like TV, unable to compell attention.
They too must seduce it. They to must charm their users into activity. They must play games with their users. (And how! That’s
now a whole new industry.) They can’t bully them, shout at them,
throw bits of chalk at them. Technically they might be able to do
this. Shouting is easy for a machine. Throwing chalk is harder,
but surely doable in due course. But were a computer try such
things the victims of it would simply switch to another one.

Seriously, if you are in the computer business, and you expect your
customers to endure pain to get the gain you promise them, then as
soon as they can they’ll desert you for the first competitor who
supplies the same gains without the pains. If Pain Then No Gain.

## http://www.rrf.org.uk

So, almost despite itself, the RRF is being sucked by the logic of
the wider culture by which it is now surrounded into making its
own distinct contribution to the computerisation of literacy teaching, a process which in the longer run is going to be epoch-making.

The RRF people have long known that one of their jobs is to act as
boosters – an unpaid sales team if you like – for technology-based
teaching techniques that they approve of. They make much in their
writings of something called “Jolly Phonics”, which makes heavy
use of video tapes to help both teachers and pupils. These and
other literacy teaching systems will inevitably mutate into more
heavily computerised systems as the years go by. Many of these
systems have their own websites.

And now, as I say, so does the RRF (see above). There you can
read their arguments about what does and doesn’t work and which
schools have switched from the latter to the former and how wonderfully they are now doing, despite the fact that many of the
children thus rescued are from hideously deprived social backgrounds.

You also get links to other websites. Some of these websites are
run by doddery old right wing political boosters of phonics and of
old fashioned teaching methods and old fashioned life generally,
urging a return to the good old days and sodden in a thoroughly
justified despair about the impossibility of ever contriving such
time travel. These people are all pain and no gain, and I and the
rest of the post-television world (which now means pretty much all
of it) say to hell with them.

But other sites have the whiff of the future about them. These are
the ones run by teaching systems enterprises that the RRF approves
of. In general, although the RRF as at present constituted is in no
state itself to be creating the right kind of computerised teaching
systems, they are extremely well equipped to review the work of
others, to recommend the good systems and to denounce the bad
ones. Their detailed and very critical analysis of the videos supplied by the DfES as part of its Literacy Strategy, National Literacy
Hour and so on, being a foretaste of the excellent analysis they
stand ready to provide for any such technology based systems.
Being teachers, they also have invaluable hands-on experience of
which systems are already achieving something useful, without too
much grief and rebellion from the kids, and which ones aren’t.

## “IT WORKS WITH THE MAJORITY OF MY STUDENTS”

For example, poking about in the RRF website I chanced upon
something called “Eddie Carron’s Electronic Library”, which Ruth
Newbury describes as “my favorite programme for boosting students’ reading ages”.

Of this system Ruth Newbury writes:

> To use the carron Libraries you need a multimedia PC with a
soundcard and a pair of earphones.

> The student brings up the programme, **and whatever their
current level of reading success starts at the lowest of the
six reading levels**.

> There are 250 “books” listed covering the six levels and designated by colour of the title. They all have a varying number
of chapters.

> The student selects his own “book” from the designated level
according to his interest. He then selects the chapter he requires. Once this is chosen the chapter will appear on screen –
a chapter always fills one screen and the font size will vary
according to the level – the lower the level – the larger the
font – and the shorter the chapter.

> Wearing the headphones (which help to cut out background
noise and also focus the student on what they have to do) the
student “reads” the chapter. This means that they move
through the text word by word by pressing the space bar, and
as they read each word will be highlighted. As soon as they
come to a word **they are not sure of**, they press any key and
the word will be heard through the headphones. It does not
matter how many words they request in one chapter. Once
they have completed the chapter the computer will take them
through the chapter again, at the speed that they used to read
the chapter initially and it will remind them of each word they
requested by saying that word again in the correct place during
the re-reading process.

> Once the second reading is completed each word they requested will disappear from the screen and they will be asked
to spell each word – with as many attempts as they need until
it is there on screen – correctly spelt.

> Once the spelling is completed the student requests a printout
of that chapter. It comes with a report at the bottom of the
sheet which gives information regarding reading speed and
how many words were requested and which were correctly
spelt.

> The students prepare their work by themselves without teacher
assistance. The programme puts successful reading performance within the reach of all students – no student fails with
the opportunity to access unknown words and to have them
reinforced before being required to read to a member of staff.

> The student then takes the chapter to the person designated to
hear him read. The aim is for the chapter to be read correctly
with no errors. All errors need to be marked on the sheet and
this provides the opportunity for further discussion regarding
errors or the text itself.

> When the student has read **three books without error** they
move on to the next level.

> And that’s all there is to it! And it works with the majority of
my students ...

I choose this example to end this piece with, not because it is a
wildly exciting application of computer technology to education,
but precisely because it is not. What the admirable Eddie Carron
has done is use computers for what computers in their present
primitive state are now best at, namely to supply an utterly predictable response concerning what is on the screen when you push one
of the buttons at the front, every time, without error, with infinite
patience and with no snide put-downs. It’s a beautifully simple
procedure. That word? How does it sound? Like this.

The computerisation of education is a momentous process bursting
with long-term significance for our civilisation. Its core processes
are destined to be as amazing and miraculous as Eddie Carron’s
Electronic Library is simple and mundane.

But that’s another story. My message now is likewise mundane.
Thank you and good luck to the Reading Reform Foundation, and
keep up the good work, even if the story turns out very differently
to what you now hope for.
