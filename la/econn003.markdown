Nationalised industries seldom go to hell straight away,
which explains why many people think they need never go
to hell at all.

When a nationalised enterprise begins, the government is
“improving” upon a going concern, about which many
people have clear and sensible opinions. It is squirting
money at something that is widely understood. A “good”
house, or agricultural “improvement”, or a “better” health
service, all mean something. The government may still
prefer mass slaughter and concentration camps, but if it *wants*
to be nice it knows how.

But as the years pass this knowledge is forgotten. Gradually, if not immediately, the money starts to be spent in
insane ways. Insane interest groups (actually very sane indeed, of course) spring up, who insist that the craziness
must continue and become crazier. The first council houses
between the wars were amazingly sensible compared to the
idiocies of later decades. The first nationalised theatres
were simply the old theatres with a bit more money to slosh
about. It was many years before that giant incinerator of
bank notes, the “national theatre”, was erected. Ditto with
the health business.

But the new megahospitals are now built and eating money,
and all contact with financial sanity has gone. The frugal
small hospitals of yesteryear, built by the private sector and
usually with the help of private charity, are being smashed
to rubble.

In other words, the “welfare state” is slowly but surely collapsing under the weight of its ignorance, unreplenished by
the knowledge of changing tastes and changing costs that
would have been provided by a free market. To put the
blame entirely on savage cuts is to blame the messenger for
the message. All that these “cuts” are is the inability of
politicians any longer to tolerate the continuously increasing
demands now being made both by the producers and consumers of welfare services, in the absence of any satisfactory idea of what these services now ought to be.

## “THE WELFARE STATE IS SAFE ...”

The British public became aware of the forthcoming disintegration of the welfare state when Mrs Thatcher announced
during the last election campaign, and repeated since that
election, that “the welfare state is safe” with her and her
government.

When politicians say things like that you know something is
up, or why would the question keep being asked? A wave
of quiet terror has spread through all the middle aged folk
of Britain, who had hitherto regarded their old age as taken
care of. Good grief, we’ll all be sleeping under Charing
Cross Bridge! These promises of Mrs T, so reminiscent of
the ones Mr Wilson used to make about not devaluing the
pound, have probably done more to galvanise the British
economy than any other public declarations she has emitted.

Next question: is this forthcoming collapse the catastrophe it
is said to be by those who will be most inconvenienced by
it? I believe not. If we libertarians thought that the collapse of the welfare state will mean the end of welfare then
we’d not be libertarians.

## I OPPOSE BARE FEET

The way to grasp just how much havoc is caused by the
welfare state is to ponder what a randomly selected industry
that is now operating in the free market would be like had it
instead been run the way that health care is run now. Consider the shoe business. This trade — such are the quirks of
fate — has escaped the clutches of the government, perhaps
because shoe-making equipment is too small and transportable to be stolen by the government.

But what would a nationalised shoe industry be like?

There would be a tiny “private sector” supplying custom
built and cruelly expensive products to plutocrats and their
imitators. That or a black market, depending on the legal
position.

Then there would be a gradually more mediocre standard
product available to the middle classes and to the luckier or
better organised proletarians, partly or wholly paid for by
the government.

And finally, about fifteen to twenty five per cent of the
population would be walking about in bare feet, or else
standing bare footed in shoe queues, despite having paid
much of the taxes needed to pay for all the shoes.

Most aspects of shoe technology would be stagnant, at the
level reached when nationalisation first struck. Changes in
design would require mass demonstrations, and skilful
lobbying by wildly unrepresentative pressure groups.

Anyone suggesting that a free market in shoes would be an
improvement on this shambles would be accused of being in
favour of bare feet.

## COSTS CAN BE REDUCED

The defenders of the chaotic nationalised *status quo* would
orate thus:

“Are you seriously suggesting that the proletarians should
be expected to buy their shoes from grasping tradesmen,
whose concern is profit rather than human need? No. A
free-for-all in shoes would mean luxury for a tiny few and
shoddy goods or nothing for the rest. After all there’d be no
profit in selling shoes to the less wealthy, would there?
Shoe costs have spiralled in recent years, you know. Do
you really think the masses could afford three hundred
pounds a pair without state provision?

“Monster. Fiend. Anti-Christ. And what is to become of
all the state cobblers?”

In short, those who argue for a free market in welfare are
accused of wanting the disasters unleashed only by a nationalised industry.

Note especially the point about costs. Costs are not things
carved by the deity onto stone tablets, but to hear people in
the NHS talk you’d think they were. If a shopkeeper in my
high street faces me with “spiralling costs” I can decide not
to incur them, either by going to a different shop where
prices are not spiralling, or by arranging my life differently.

On the other hand, if in a free market some grasping Taiwanese materials technologist or brutal Romanian personnel
manager learns how to undercut the prices I now pay I can
at once take advantage of the fact. With shoes this is what
has happened, and the local shoemen have had to damn well
unspiral their costs or go bust. Ditto in textiles.

As with costs so with technology, in fact these two subjects
are really the same subject. People talk about “new technology” as if it was delivered annually from Mars, and then
climbs out of its parcel and applies itself, at a rate and in a
way that cannot in any way be influenced by earthmen. Yet
the question of whether new technology is applied, and if so
whether in such a way as to divide costs by ten or multiply
them by a hundred, is crucially dependent on the wider political and economic setting within which the relevant
choices are made. Gutter Marxists are right about that if
about nothing else.

That medical costs have reached the ozone layer is not because medicine is an inherently expensive activity, but because no rewards are available to those who might have
kept medical costs down, or pushed them down even further
as has happened with portable radios.

## MEDICINE MEANS KNOWLEDGE SPREADING

I’m not a doctor myself, although my sister is, but I do have
some thoughts about how a wholly free market in medicine
might have developed had it been allowed.

(By the way, THERE IS NOT A FREE MARKET IN
MEDICINE IN AMERICA. If you think there is, jet over
there and try selling medicine to the first Americans who
pass your door, at fifty cents a session let us say, and then
count the number of minutes that elapse before the local
police, alerted by the government sponsored doctors, move
in and close you down.)

What I usually want from a doctor is information, not pills.
I want to know that it is this month’s local bug that I’ve got
rather than congenital herpes, and I want to know the likely
course of my malady, so that I can rearrange my affairs and
my mind accordingly.

For many centuries doctors knew *nothing* about curing
people, and their new found glimmerings of knowledge in
this area have quite gone to their heads. Even when a real
cure is available it can often be self administered, provided
the patient is well informed. The genuine brilliance
achieved by doctors in such arts as the reconstruction of car
crash victims or war wounded are heroic exceptions, but exceptions they remain. Mostly what we want of doctors is *knowledge*
of what is wrong and *knowledge* of what, if anything, we can do about it.

The cost cutting possibilities in the application of the new
electronic information technology to medicine are obvious.
Diagnosis, treatment, cure (when possible), medical *education*, should all mean computers (and in due course computer controlled videos) just as the information processing
job done by bankers has meant computers to bankers.

But we’re doing that, say the doctors. We already *have*
computers, and a right pig’s dinner they are making of
everything! But of course. They are making just the mess
of medicine that I would make of a bank if I computerised
that (through me being, say, the Minister for Banking). Yet
the banks have computerised successfully, by trying out
many different schemes for computerisation on a small scale
until they had something that looked good, by copying that,
and by putting the winners of the race in charge of the
losers. In medicine the old winners have stayed in charge,
and the potential new computerised winners were shot dead
by the starter’s gun.

When it is said that “medicine” is getting more expensive,
what is meant is that bedmakers, housekeepers, skivvies,
cooks, bottle washers, brain surgeons and other menials are
getting more expensive, as indeed they are. But if medical
knowledge were separated from domestic service it would
be revealed as something that is getting cheaper by the day.
Customers faced with on the one hand knowledge, and on
the other hand knowledge-plus-domestic service, *and with the prices*, will not hesitate.

## THE FUTURE WINS

Despite all the obstruction caused by the NHS the computer
will eventually transform traditional medicine out of all recognition, when satisfactory diagnostic computer software,
complete with a friendly bedside manner, becomes available
at mass market prices. In other words when good quality
free market medicine becomes as hard to control as the shoe
business. As with every important new medical technique,
this one will be fiercely resisted by all but a few of the
doctors. “But doctor, my computer says ...”

More mundane market disciplines are impinging upon medicine via the growing private sector both in traditional
medical care, and in the newly exploding industry of health
information, in the form of books and magazines. Read the
latest BUPA adverts to see how the desire not to waste
money has suddenly crackled into life in the private sector,
where patients (via insurance companies) are paying the
bills.

If you were to put your mind to the question of how free
market roads might be made to work better than the mess
we grope about in now, or free market “community policing”, or free market USSR scaring, then you too could think
of several pages-worth of futurology as good as mine and
maybe better.

Most of our ideas would turn out to be wrong, but the market, like the best teachers, rewards success, while allowing
errors to be quietly forgotten. The “collapse of the welfare
state” will result in *much more* welfare
