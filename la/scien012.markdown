title: Clone On! The Nature-Nurture Controversy and How Human Cloning Will Illuminate It
permalink: /la/scien012.html
---

Humans have a nature. We have a maximum of two arms,
rather than five, six or fifty. None of us is thirty foot or two
inches tall. We come in two genders, the females having breasts
and the males not, the males being on average taller and
stronger. None of us has wings like a bird, or sonar like a bat.

But pointing out that humans have a nature isn’t the same as
knowing in detail what it is. Yes, humans have two arms. Yes,
human females aren’t the same as human males. But it doesn’t
follow that because, for example, “women are different” (which
they definitely are) we know all about these differences and that
“science proves” that women should stick to housekeeping and
child-rearing and avoid front line service as fighter pilots.

The crude physical outlines of human nature are clear enough.
But exactly how our genes interact with our surroundings is
much harder to tease out. Am I argumentative because I was
born argumentative? Would I have become as argumentative as
I am now if I’d been snatched away from my parents at birth
and raised by people who always agreed with one another? Or
was I raised to be argumentative, on account of my father being
a courtroom lawyer and my mother believing that arguing is
good for you? Was it my nature or my nurture that made me an
in-your-face libertarian pamphleteer?

## NATURE, NURTURE AND POLITICS

The argument about the relative importance of heredity and environment
in determining different human destinies is complicated by the fact
that this argument is now and always has been embroiled in
politics. Simplifying this debate brutally, collectivists have accused
“genetic determinists” of deriving false and cruel political ideas
from a view of human nature that mis-states the facts of, and attaches
too much importance to, the human genetic inheritance. Others have
accused collectivist “environmental determinists” of saying that the
human mind is a blank slate upon which social forces scribble at
will.[^1]

My impression of this debate is that straw men abound, and that
all serious writers of whatever political hue actually agree (a)
that heredity and environment are both crucial,[^2] and (b) that just
because something is natural, that doesn’t necessarily make it
right. It has been argued that humans have an inborn disposition
towards “ethnic cleansing” which particular social circumstances
may trigger. But we still denounce such slaughters, hence the
euphemism. Some geneticists have argued that human males
have an inborn tendency to kill their stepchildren, but few would
excuse behaviour like that merely because it is natural.[^3] Cancer
is definitely natural, but that doesn’t stop medical scientists
trying to eradicate it, nor should it.

The facts of the nature-nurture controversy are what they are,
and no self-respecting moralist or political theorist need fear
them. As far as I’m concerned, the more scientists can learn
about such things the better. If any of my beliefs about what
*should be* turn out to be based on beliefs about what *is* which
are later proved false, that will be my problem.

## IDENTICAL TWINS

But where might new evidence concerning the nature-nurture controversy
come from? There is already a small but illuminating treasure trove of
scientific data which particularly bears on this debate, namely the
studies that have been made of identical twins. Particularly revealing
are identical twins who, because of adoption or through muddle in
maternity hospitals, have grown up apart and unaware of each other’s
existence, that is to say with the same nature but a different
nurture. A recent British TV show revealed uncanny similarities in the
way in which separated identical twins lived out their mutually
ignorant lives, and equally revealing differences. When reunited, they
were shown with the same pot bellies and the same psychological
dispositions. They had heart attacks at the same time, did the same
sorts of jobs and dressed alike. But their marriage partners
varied. Fascinating stuff, but tantalisingly insufficient as
scientific data. After all, these twins would have shared the same
massaudience TV shows and the same political and cultural fashions, at
the same time. So their nurture wasn’t so different after all.  The
good news, scientifically speaking, is that this tiny trickle of twin
study data may be about to become a flood.

## PLAYING GOD?

In July 1996, some scientists famously succeeded in cloning a
sheep, and the ability to clone people can’t be far away.[^4]
A widespread opinion about human cloning, as about so many
other things, is that there ought to be a law against it. I hold to
what I take to be the libertarian orthodoxy on the subject. If
some cloners want to clone, and the clonees consent, then whose
rights are being violated? Nobody’s. Human cloning ought to
be allowed.

Human cloning surely will be allowed in some parts of the world, if
only because the governmental means of preventing it will not be
omnipresent. A few cloned humans will be made in various more or less
different sorts of circumstances, while the rest of us carry on having
babies the regular old way — which is the ideal way for us all to find
out what we think of the new procedure. I daresay we’ll discover that,
as with most other clever ideas, human cloning is a good thing if done
well in the right circumstances, but bad if done badly or in the wrong
circumstances. And the practice may then spread.

Will we be “playing God”, if we allow human cloning? I think playing
God is just a rude way of saying that we like to manipulate our
circumstances to our advantage, the nice wording for which is being
civilised. And wouldn’t forbidding human cloning also be rather
Godlike in its presumptuousness? Being “unnatural” isn’t automatically
wrong, any more than being natural is automatically right.

A friend recently put it to me that there is no principled basis for
forbidding human cloning which would not also forbid many
regular human births. If I thought more about that statement, I’d
probably agree with it even more than I do now, but this piece is
not about all of my reasons for thinking that human cloning
should be legally allowed; it is about just one reason. Simply: if
such cloning is allowed, we will learn a lot about life in general,
and about the nature-versus-nurture controversy in particular.

## LITTLE HITLERS

Remember that film called *The Boys From Brazil*? The boys in
question were Adolf Hitler clones. Suppose a squad of genetic
copies of the old monster had indeed been turned loose upon the
world, for real. Well, I daresay it would have been quite scary,
as the film assumed, especially if all the little Hitlers were raised
and educated by aging Nazis.

But would it not also have been decidedly interesting? Simply from the
point of view of understanding Hitler himself, and the way that he
interacted with his particular environment, the story of how these new
Hitlers turned out would have been extraordinarily illuminating.

Would they all have done as they were told by their Nazi masters?
Would they all have turned into rabid anti-semites? I suspect that
several might have shunned Nazism and become communists or
scientologists, or perhaps libertarians. (Many libertarians would
fiercely deny that libertarianism could have anything in common with
Nazism, but the fact that they both end with the same three letters
gives that game away at once.)

What sort of personal style would these Hitler clones have displayed?
Would they have shared the original Hitler’s fondness for public
speaking? If so, would their speeches have had the same atmosphere
about them as the original Hitler’s speeches?  Or would their
speechmaking style have been different, to suit changing
communicational fashions and technologies?

Would any of them, had they arrived at adolescence in the sixties,
have become hippies? If so, would their hippy opinions have had
anything in common with Hitler’s views? (I’m thinking of such things
as their views about “nature”.)

Would any of them have gone into show business?

Would some of the little Hitlers have become architects, as Hitler
himself tried to do, but failed?

Would they all have been obsessed, as Hitler was, with making a
huge stir in the world? Assuming they managed to live down
the scandal of their genetic origins, or perhaps as part of trying
to do this, would many just have settled down into contentedly
obscure lives as electricians, teachers, or civil servants?

What would their family lives have been like? Would most of
them have stuck to the original Hitler pattern (a mistress, no
kids, a dog), or would most have settled down with wives and
kids, and some of them with pussy cats?

Would any of them have been gay?

As with these hypothetical and fictionalised boys, so it will be with
any other clutches of cloned humans, some genetically copied from
super-achievers or admired celebrities, others merely reproduced
because of their supposed medical, mental or physical advantages, born
in different places, and at different times (which will eliminate
identical mass media or general politicocultural background as
possible alternative causes of similarity), and very possibly — like
the most scientifically revealing twins in the twin studies — in
ignorance of each other’s existence.  Talk about a scientific gold
mine!

## A FLOOD OF TRUTH

Many will quickly deduce the central point of this piece simply from
its title. But maybe even the small point that human cloning will help
us to learn a lot may throw some further light on the human cloning
debate. As I say, this is a politically fraught subject. Insofar as a
person’s strongly held views about politics or about anything else are
based on what he might fear to be false axioms concerning the
importance either of human nature or of human nurture, then that
person will be nervous about what cloning might reveal. The very flood
of truth which I eagerly anticipate, and which causes me to want the
freedom to clone to be accepted, might cause others to oppose it. But
the fear of truth is not honourable, and those gripped by it may dress
it up as something else, such as the fear of the many catastrophes
allegedly likely to be caused by cloning freedom.  The rest of us need
have no such fears. Human cloning will cause all kinds of
difficulties, and may indeed have frightful hidden dangers, especially
if it becomes very popular. (That some may have intellectually ignoble
reasons for opposing it doesn’t mean they’ll necessarily be wrong in
what they do say.) But as a way of learning more about what sort of
creatures we are and could become, human cloning will be a revelation.

As a human being, I say to would-be cloners: do it if you want
to, but watch out, there may indeed be troubles ahead as well as
delights. As a science fan, and as one who favours the growth
of human knowledge generally, I say: clone on![^5]

    Steven Rose, R. C. Lewontin and Leon J. Kamin, Not In Our Genes —
    Biology, Ideology and Human Nature, Penguin Books, Harmondsworth,
    Middlesex, 1990, first published by Pantheon Books in 1984. Among
    those criticised are Richard Dawkins, author of The Selfish Gene, first
    published by Oxford University Press in 1976, with a new edition
    published in 1989 See more recently, Steven Pinker’s The Language
    Instinct, Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, Middlesex, 1994. The title
    alone makes it clear that for Pinker there is far more to human genetic
    programming than mere physical externalities like arms, legs or breasts.

[^2]: Here, for example, are Rose, Lewontin and Kamin criticising cultural
    determinism: “The post-1968 New Left in Britain and the United States
    has shown a tendency to see human nature as almost infinitely plastic, to
    deny biology and acknowledge only social construction. The helplessness
    of childhood, the existential pain of madness, the failties of ald age were
    all transmuted to mere labels reflecting the disparities of power. But this
    denial of biology is so contrary to actual lived experience that it has
    rendered people the more ideologically vulnerable to the “common-sense”
    appeal of reemerging biological determinism. Indeed, we argue ... that
    such cultural determinism can be as oppressive in obfuscating real
    knowledge about the complexity of the world we live in as is biological
    determinism.” (p. 10)

[^3]: For a whole book about nasty but natural human behaviour, see Richard
    Wrangham and Dale Peterson, Demonic Males — Apes and the Origins of
    Human Violence, Bloomsbury, London, 1996, paperback edition 1997.

[^4]: For more on the cloning story, see Gina Kolata, Clone — The Road to
    Dolly and the Path Ahead, Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, Middlesex, 1997.
    Kolata quotes Jacques Cohen, scientific director of assisted
    reproduction at the Institute of Reproductive Medicine and Science at St
    Barnabas Hospital, Livingstone, New Jersey: “In my opinion it is all
    nonsense whether it [human reproduction] is sexual or asexual. The
    whole argument is sort of silly — so what? People will agree with me in
    fifty years.” (p. 210) Let’s hope so.

[^5]: A final footnote. This is a piece about genetic copying. It is not about
    genetic engineering, which seems to me far more problematic, even if my
    libertarian prejudice is that this too should be allowed. Making only a
    few copies of what already exists is one thing; modifying genes and
    making lots of copies is something else again.
