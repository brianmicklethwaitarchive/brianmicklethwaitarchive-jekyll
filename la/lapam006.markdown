# INTRODUCTION

On Monday October 16th 1984, the British Medical Association
announced that it wanted cigarette advertising banned.

It was in response to this announcement, and the growing
cacophony of demands for restrictions on, even the outright
banning of, smoking that the Libertarian Alliance submitted a
report, written by Brian Micklethwait, to the Home Secretary, the
Minister of Health and the British Medical Association.

## WHY DEFEND SMOKERS AND THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY?

Why are we going to the effort of defending the rights of tobbaco
smokers and manufacturers? Even those who accept the view
that individuals have a right to smoke, and businessmen to supply
them with the means of so doing, frequently see the issue as a
relatively minor one. In my view it is not. The growing campaign
against the right to smoke is part and parcel of two much broader,
and undoubtedly significant, movements.

The first is the hysterical campaign against drug addiction in
general. Tobbaco is indeed a drug, and in some respects a more
harmful one than many of those at present legally prohibited. It is
not surprising that paternalists and authoritarians of all political
stripes should extend their campaign against currently illegal
substances to those traditionally socially accepted in the West.

The second is the hubristic “imperialism” of the medical profession.
Nineteenth century libertarians were never more prescient than
when they predicted the overbearing arrogance of the "professionalised" expert, ever ready to set him/herself up as the coercive
guardian over the lives of ordinary people.[^1] It is thus the British
Medical Association, the ne plus ultra of closed shop monopoly
privilege and arrogance, that almost weekly issues demands for
curbs on individual free choice.

## PROFIT AND PRINCIPLE

The Libertarian Alliance will undoubtedly be accused of being in
the pay of the tobacco industry. Would that it were so. We would
certainly be happy to accept any financial assistance they would
care to offer. But in fact they ran a mile when confronted with the
sort of analysis contained in this report. Like most businessmen
they will not think in terms of principles. And this is why, if left to
themselves, they will lose. They will not accept a defence of their
industry which is argued in terms of principles because such
principles would obviously apply to the “taboo” drugs as well. But
no amount of embarrassed evasion on their part can conceal the
fact that tobacco is a drug and that the only coherent defense of
the individuals right to consume it, and of others to manufacture it,
applies to all consciousness altering substances, whatever their
degree of harmfulness.

The exponents of restrictions on and/or banning of tobacco realise
this well. “In terms of addiction and sheer physical agony”, writes
the Socialist Paul Foot, “tobacco is far more harmful” than other
drugs.[^2] Freedom is always menaced most when it is faced by a
combination of the “right” (the BMA and assorted paternalist health
experts) and the "left". The left, as well as joining in the current
social panic over heroin and cocaine has seen another opportunity
to target the “big boys” (Foot’s phrase) of capitalism and to
establish the principle of state dictation. In the words of Paul Foot:
“Socialism is founded on the notion of social responsibility. Drugs
which are obviously a menace to physical and mental health must
be discouraged and, in extreme cases, outlawed.”[^3] Social
responsibilty is, of course, simply another nice sounding phrase,
so beloved of socialists, for the state bossing people around - for
their own good, of course.[^4]

Libertarians should view the growing campaign against the rights
of smokers for what it is — a matter of principle. A common way
to establish the hegemony of particular principles is to fight on
apparently minor issues. A victory therein renders the extension of
ones principles to major issues more likely. The advocates of
paternalism and statism certainly realise this. The growing
success of their campaign against smoking bodes ill for individual
liberty in general. But likewise, should a counter attack prove
successful it could well popularise the libertarian concepts of moral
freedom and self-ownership.

We hope that this report will provide a source of rigorous
arguments to those who oppose this latest manifestation of the
“nanny” state — and a realisation that if they wish to oppose such
“nannyism” on smoking, they can do so only by a principled
support of freedom for all.

We have also added here the replies we received from the
Departments of Health and of Trade. Typically, the British Medical
Association did not see fit to reply or even acknowledge the report.

The approach of the Socialist Workers Party to the whole subject of drugs is representative of their political approach in general, and of its honesty.

# WHY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STOP HARASSING THE TOBACCO TRADE

## BRIAN MICKLETHWAIT

### A Report Submitted to the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health and the British Medical Association

Smoking makes me sick. This is not a metaphor. It literally
makes me ill, both when others do it near me and on those very
rare occasions when I am persuaded to do it myself. When I go
by train, which is often, I always use a non-smoking compartment.
Because of all this, and because I am the kind of person who
wants to feel proud of what he does rather than just pile up
money, I do not work for the tobacco trade.

Nevertheless, it seems to me that the attack on smoking has got
out of hand. Principles and practices which I greatly value are, via
the campaign against smoking, being attacked in dangerous ways
by thoroughly dangerous people. Some of the attackers do not
care one way or another about principles. They just want to curb
smoking. But others are quite consciously opposed to the
principles that I will shortly be defending, and are using the
smoking debate to attack these principles. Then, when the vital
points of principle have all been conceded, the attack switches to
other less disreputable trades. The cure for this is that all who
have the nerve for it must insist that the makers, sellers and
smokers of tobacco should be the subjects and beneficiaries of
exactly the same legal principles and civil liberties as the rest of
us. It’s far more socially acceptable to go in to bat for the Roman
Catholic Church of Poland, for the black victims of Apartheid, or for
a journalist who is refusing to reveal his sources, than it is to put in
a good word for the tobacco trade, but for now I’m going to forget
about that.

## HARMFULNESS DOES NOT JUSTIFY GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE

Let me start where I started first, with the fact that smoking makes
me sick. According to the anti-smoking propagandists it makes
those who do it regularly even sicker, often fatally so. Whenever a
moral atmosphere becomes established, certain truths become
unmentionable, and I have no doubt that there are scientific
researchers who have discovered that smoking is actually, in some
ways, less harmful than it is made out to be, but who, valuing their
lives and front gardens, have kept quiet. I once attended a CND
meeting where a woman in the audience queried the statistics that
one of the speakers had used, and thus argued that nuclear
explosions are not as terrible as the speaker had claimed. She
was almost lynched. Nevertheless, I do believe that smoking, like
nuclear explosions, can be harmful to health, and in some ways
and for some people very harmful indeed. This is one reason why
I have made no effort to overcome my physical revulsion to
smoking. Another reason is that smoking is addictive, or so I have
been told and persuaded.

But the above facts, if facts they are, do not justify the government
interfering in the tobacco trade. If people kill themselves by
smoking that is their look out. People should, I insist, be allowed
to do things that are physically harmful, provided that they harm
only themselves. If they become addicted to smoking and are
subsequently unable or unwilling to kick the habit, bad luck. If
tobacco salesmen were in the habit of kidnapping people,
strapping them into chairs and forcing them to smoke cigarettes
like so many rabbits in a cancer lab’ then indeed the forces of law
and order should be summoned, just as they should if I were to
kidnap you and then beat you up (or for that matter kidnap you
and force you to listen to Mozart piano concertos). But this isn’t
what is happening. The people who buy cigarettes choose to buy
them. They are not forced to.

So am I, says the anti-smoking lobbyist, in favour of legalising
cannabis trading, regardless of whether or not it is harmful? (He
often is!) And what of heroin, which definitely is very addictive and
very harmful, unless we have all been grievously deceived? Does
my “bad luck” principle let them off the hook and into the market
place as well? Indeed, yes. On the other hand I am very
unradical about another very dangerous and addictive drug,
alchohol, in which I quite often indulge and which I definitely think
should remain legal. I am even more partial to coffee, which is
also mildly addictive, and believe that this too should remain legal,
as should other potentially addictive and hence socially disruptive
activities like sex, golf, microcomputing and listening to the music
of Richard Wagner. In fact rather than allow myself to be backed
gradually into the corner labelled “liberty” let me proudly plant
myself there. I think people should have the right to cut their own
wrists.

## THE ALLEGED NEED TO BE PROTECTED FROM OURSELVES

But don’t people need to be protected from themselves?

This word “need” invariably rears its ugly head whenever anyone
is suggesting reductions in individual liberty. People may “need”
all sorts of things, but this in no way entitles the government to
give them what they “need” and then land the rest of us with the
bill.

But what of the bill if these needs are not met, if people are simply
allowed to carry on smoking regardless? People who damage
themselves, whether by cutting their wrists (clumsily) or by
smoking, have to be looked after. Those who don’t smoke are
forced to pay for gigantic research efforts into bronchitis, lung
cancer and so on, merely for the benefit of those who do.
Answer: such coercive funding should cease. People should be
free to smoke, and they should then have to live (or die) with the
consequences; consequences in pain, medical insurance costs,
and in the form of people who say that kissing them is like kissing
an ash tray.

My God! (The anti-smoking man is now very excited.) You don’t
care about needs. You think old age pensioners racked with
cancer should be left by the government to die. Where does all
this leave the Welfare State? Answer: in the dustbin of history
where it belongs. The absolute best way to provide anything is for
fat, rich, vulgar, Rolls-Royce flaunting (cigar smoking) capitalists all
competing with each other like dancing dervishes to be in charge
of the entire business, and for the government to get clean out of
it. This is as true for health care as it is for food, cars or surf
boards, and it is a tragedy that the law in all countries now
prevents this from being obvious. What! Is capitalism best even
for the very poor? Especially for the very poor.

## HOSTILITY TO CAPITALISM

In an earlier draft of this the above sentences in praise of
capitalism were in brackets, signalling that they were a digression.
Yet hostility to capitalism as such is central to the whole smoking
debate. Many of the anti-smoking lobbyists are hostile to the
tobacco trade not just because they are hostile to tobacco, but
because they are even more hostile towards trade. Trade is even
more wicked, they hint, when it is international.

The truth is that trade is an excellent thing, even when international, and that it is even excellent when — sin upon sin — it is
conducted by a multinational corporation. Multinational corporations, however large and however smoothly run and cleverly
advertised, are also excellent things, for they are built on the
voluntary acts of free people. This is true even of multinational
tobacco corporations which sell their products in the Third World, a
place notorious for the number of “needs” it contains and hence
excuses for trampling on individual liberty. Should tobacco
corporations be allowed to peddle their products, as they are now
doing with such success, to educationally disadvantaged Africans?
Answer: yes.

To explain with any eloquence why, I must speculate about the
benefits people get from smoking. Smoking provides, I suggest, a
soothing, easing, calming effect. It bestows poise, social ease, a
feeling of being on top of things rather than at the mercy of
events. It may only have effects like this because the smoker
thinks it does, or because it gives him something to do with one of
his hands, but such poise is real enough, for if you feel poised you
probably are. When smoking was at the height of its popularity in
the rich countries, this was why people like The Saint and
Sherlock Holmes used to smoke, and I’m sure it’s just the same in
poorer countries now. Equally, in poor countries now as here in
the past, the question of what smoking would do to you when you
got to be eighty was very academic, because if smoking didn’t get
you by then something else almost certainly would.

## THE INDIRECT ATTACKS ON SMOKING

Although the tobacco trade in the rich countries is now in decline,
it is not yet illegal, and if people can be persuaded to proclaim and
agree with arguments like mine it will stay legal. But there are
other ways of getting at smoking. One of the most serious
diseases now caused by smoking is cancer of the wallet. Taxes
on smoking (somewhat over 5 billion a year) are of the same order
of magnitude as the total bill for the National Health Service (over
£16 billion — much of it wasted), so no government is likely to kill
this particular golden goose. But no group of traders and
customers should have to pay protection money on this
extortionate scale, and in my opinion taxation should be done
away with altogether, on all products. If people want any of the
services now provided by governments let them buy those
services, just as they now buy cigarettes. Meanwhile I note that
the taxes paid by smokers make nonsense of the claim that the
rest of us have to pay for them to be looked after.

Even more insidious have been the attacks on the tobacco trade’s
freedom of expression. There is a huge battery of government
controls on what cigarette advertisers may say and where they
may say it, all of which should be scrapped. Worse, every
cigarette poster and packet must contain a strip of anti-smoking
propaganda in the form of a government health warning. This
really is outrageous. People who think smoking is harmful to
health and want to say so should pay their own advertising bills.
They always claim that this would be too expensive, and that the
big, bad, rich tobacco barons would have the argument all to
themselves. But one effect of advertising is to create a strong
interest in the other side of the story, which the media people are
then glad to proclaim at no cost to those telling it. Much the most
forceful anti-smoking propaganda has been printed free of charge
in the editorial columns of newspapers.

Anyway, the belief that no money is to be made criticising smoking
is false. Insurance companies, speaking with all the eloquence of
anyone who is talking to you via your bank account and entirely for
their own money-making reasons, circulate very hard-hitting
anti-smoking messages, in the form of varying insurance premiums
for smokers and non-smokers. Insofar as doctors are paid to keep
people healthy, rather than just for treating people when they get
sick, then they too spread the same message, assuming they
agree with it. Insofar as government enforced professional codes
of practice, libel laws, and so on, inhibit such muck spreading,
then these curbs should also be scrapped. In this matter as in so
many, restrictions breed more restrictions, while a determined
effort to keep certain freedoms even if they appear dangerous
soon reveals other freedoms which don’t exist but should, and
which might solve the problems seemingly caused by the original
freedoms.

A standard argument against any kind of advertising is that it is
liable to influence children. It certainly is. Yet even supposing that
it were desirable to prevent this, could it be done except by hiding
most advertising from adults as well? Actually, the more children
are exposed to the big, bad outside world the better they learn to
cope with it; the more they take its crazier claims with a pinch of
salt. Conversely, to treat children all the time “like children” is to
make them permanently infantile. Whereupon, naturally, further
demands are heard to the effect that adults should also be treated
like children. There is far too much of this already.

## THE BENEFITS OF ADVERTISING, AND OF PROPERTY

Much cigarette advertising consists only of reminding smokers of
the continuing existence of certain brands. Much to the
annoyance of their critics, the cigarette traders now do this not
only with posters but also by sponsoring symphony orchestras,
snooker competitions and the like. Even this castrated form of
advertising serves a useful purpose. Smoking any cigarette may
eventually kill you, but the smoker is right to assume that with all
this money being spent boosting them he is unlikely to be killed
straight away by any of the big name brands. Speaking generally,
brand names do far more for consumer safety than government
regulations ever have. Traders want you to buy their goods again
and again, which won’t happen if your first bite (or puff) kills you,
or even if you are merely one of millions who read about such an
event in the newspapers. When those poor old folk died of
botulism from eating a tin of a famous brand of salmon the impact
on the sales of this brand was catastrophic, which is why the
makers of branded goods always try like hell to prevent this kind of
thing. If all cigarette advertising were banned, even of brand
names, then brand loyalty would be impossible and money spent
making any particular brand of cigarette safer would be money
wasted. The next step would be to make it illegal to profit from
these now genuinely lethal products, and it would only be possible
to get them from doctors. Even if smoking itself remained legal
these measures alone would be enough to hand the entire
business over to gangsters. Prostitution is “legal” now, but you
can’t advertise it without ludicrous euphemisms or profit from it on
any scale so the gangsters (who specialise in ignoring legal rules
— this is their trade) run that too.

Another tactic for getting at smoking is to increase inexorably the
number of places where smoking is banned. Insofar as such bans
are imposed by property owners of their own free will, or in
response to demand from non-smoking customers like me then I
welcome such changes. But banning smoking in all “public” (that
is, publicly owned) places would, I think, be wrong. Smokers are
members of the public too, who pay their taxes (through the nose).
The proper answer to this dilemma about publicly owned places is
that there are far too many of them. When anything is “publicly”
owned it isn’t really owned at all. All the arguments about exactly
who may do exactly what in them become in essence insoluble
and in practice solved by the people with the most political pull
winning out against the rest. Traditionally politicians have favoured
smoke-filled rooms, but this could well change. The institution of
property is a better way than politics of settling such disputes,
because although the numerous, the high and the mighty get most
of it others get their smaller bits too, and also because there is
much less futile wrangling. There should be different smoking
regulations (and different prostitution, picketing, music-making,
horse-riding and hitch-hiking regulations) in different “public”
places, according to the varying preferences of the owners and
differing tastes of their customers.

## THE TACTICS OF DEFENDING SMOKERS’ RIGHTS

I do not know what tactics the tobacco traders should use to
defend their business. If they want to print a billion copies of this
pamphlet and give them away with the next twenty billion
cigarettes they sell, they are more than welcome. If they want to
pay me, fine. The more the merrier. On the other hand, is it wise
for them to get into arguments about legalising heroin, abolishing
taxation, selling off Hyde Park, and about the immense ethical
superiority of capitalism when compared to tyranny? And would
they want to pay someone who even hints that smoking could
make anyone feel less than ecstatically healthy? Probably not.

Also, would tobacco traders really want all the government created
obstacles now strewn in their path to disappear overnight? This I
also doubt. Since their expertise consists partly of knowing all
about such things, better than potential competitors who know only
about how to make cigarettes, not even this is probable.

On the other hand, to concede that the Welfare State is
marvellous and that they are just proud as Punch to be paying for
it all, and to admit that, yes, people do have to be protected
somewhat and that of course some regulation is necessary, and
that “no one is arguing for complete freedom”, etcetera etcetera, is
also very dangerous, it seems to me. Too often the argument is
allowed to consist entirely of claims and counter-claims about
whether smoking is or is not dangerous, and then once it is
agreed that like everything else that is any fun it does have its
risks the rest of the territory is overrun, when in fact it can and
should be stoutly defended. On the other hand, the tobacco
barons may calculate that for all its political pitfalls, to have people
arguing for freedom with all guns blazing may at least somewhat
slow the steady drift away from it, and thus that pieces like this
one are on balance helpful to them. I don’t know.

What I do know is that we who value freedom first, and tobacco
second or less or not at all, must be ready to argue for freedom
for smokers and for tobacco traders as for everyone else.
Freedom never vanishes all at once. To defend it you have to
draw the line in the right place from the start and then hold that
line, no matter what company you find yourself keeping.

17 December 1984

Dear Sir

I have been asked to thank you for and reply to your letter and
enclosures of 31 October to the Minister for Health and the
Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Health) about Smoking.
While a number of points were raised the main burden of your
letter was in support of the freedom of the individual and that of
the tobacco industry.

I am sorry that your organisation considers that action by the
Government aimed at reducing smoking is unjustifiable interference with both the comercial activities of the tobacco industry
and the liberty of those who wish to smoke. It is of course the
case that except on radio and television, tobacco companies in
this country are free to advertise cigarettes but in view of the
established facts about smoking and health, both the government
and the medical profession would be failing in their duty if they did
not make every effort to inform people of the danger and
discourage them from smoking.

Thus, while acknowledging that people have the right to choose
whether or not to smoke, the government has a responsibility,
through its health education policies, to ensure that nobody does
so without being aware of the health hazards involved. These
policies are of course backed up by voluntary agreements
between the government and the tobacco industry.

The government’s policy is not to dictate what people and industry
should, or should not do but rather, through persuasion and
education, to alert the public to the dangers of smoking and
thereby seek to prevent children and young people, the most
vulnerable in our society, from taking up the habit and to
encourage existing smokers to give up.

Yours sincerely,

F. A. L i n d s a y

Dear Sir

Thank you for your letter of 31 October addressed to the Home
Secretary — to which I have been asked to reply — and for
enclosing a copy of your report Why the Government Should Stop
Harassing the Tobacco Trade.
You might like to know that the Department of Trade and Industry
regards the manufacture of tobacco products as an industrial
activity like any other, to be judged according to purely commercial
criteria. However, the Government feel they have a responsibility
to make the public aware of the potential dangers of smoking and
to restrain the more obtrusive forms of cigarette advertising, and to
this end the Department of Health and Social Security has
negotiated a series of voluntary agreements with the industry.
Yours sincerely,
