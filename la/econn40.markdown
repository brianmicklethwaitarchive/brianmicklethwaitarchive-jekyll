title: "Against Charity: Charity, Favours, Trade and the Welfare State"
permalink: /la/econn40.html
---
<p>Libertarians favour the abolition of the
welfare state, and its replacement by voluntary methods of
achieving human happiness.</p>

<p>The commonest objection from people who
hear this idea for the first time is that although such a
transformation will probably be splendid for the fit and the
strong, it will be hell on earth for the lame, the halt and
the poor. There must be a safety net, a longstop, a back-up
system, or some other such metaphorical contrivance, to look
after the losers in the great race of life, when the
free-for-all of liberty has trampled them into the freezing
mud and left them to die. The devil must somehow be prevented
from taking the hind-most. That is why we have taxes, and
that is why we ought to pay them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with this objection to
libertarianism, but I entirely agree that the question of
what happens to the people at the bottom of whatever heap is
being argued about is a very important one. I&#39;m a
libertarian not because I disagree with these critics of
libertarianism about the importance of this question, but
because I disagree about their answer.</p>

<p>Many libertarians, having denounced
compulsory benevolence administered with other people&#39;s
money, and faced with this objection about the plight of the
very poor and very defenceless in an untaxed society, often
then resort with exaggerated optimism to &quot;charity&quot;.
Having trashed compulsory altruism, they attach particular
value to the voluntary sort. Organised but voluntary
benevolence, say such libertarians, can deal with all of
those otherwise hopeless cases that the welfare state is now
said to take care of. Charity will be enough. <a href=
"#N1">[1]</a></p>

<p>But I expect little good to come from
charity. I prefer unfettered, unrestrained capitalism, which
I consider to be the absolute best &quot;welfare state&quot;
there is. Historically, it is capitalism which has rescued
the poor and unfortunate from their plight, insofar as
anything ever has, not charity. If the poor, the unhappy and
the incapable ever do have much success looking after
themselves, it tends to be through their own efforts, and
through the fact that they were lucky enough to live in a
society where they were entitled to sell the results of their
own efforts, however meagre the efforts and however miserable
the price. The only important contribution made by the mere
benevolence of richer people is that these richer persons
have occasionally had the sense and the decency to understand
this truth about poverty and how to relieve it, instead of
merely salving their unthinking consciences by chucking gold
coins out of their carriages.</p>

<p>I assert that those libertarians who do
argue for &quot;charity&quot; in this optimistic way are
overestimating its value. We should instead, when arguing for
voluntary rather than compulsory arrangements, emphasise the
enormously liberating possibilities of trade, of peaceful
exchange between free people. We should not rely on
&quot;charity&quot; to fill the gaps in our proposed
welfare-stateless world. Even for the most unwealthy,
unhappy, unlucky and untalented, I contend,
&quot;charity&quot; is a dubious deal to accept, and trade a
much better one.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">The Perceived Value of
Charity</font></b></p>

<p>The reason for the ineffectiveness - and
often downright harmfulness - of much charitable endeavour is
rooted in its economic nature.</p>

<p>If I cook meals at a cost to me of £10 per
meal and sell one of these meals to you at my regular price
of, say, £15, then for you to have accepted this arrangement,
you have to believe that the meal is going to be worth £15 to
you. You could sometimes be mistaken, but on the whole, if I
am going to get a regular supply of customers for such meals,
I am going to have to make those meals worth £15.</p>

<p>But suppose instead that I am cooking
meals on a charitable basis. Suppose now that I simply give
the meals away. Now the situation is quite different. Now,
all that is required for me to get a steady flow of
customers&quot; is that my meals, which still cost £10 to
make, should be worth more than nothing to those who eat
them.</p>

<p>Just the same point about error applies to
those who accept charitable gifts as to those who accept
business deals. The receivers of charity can also be wrong
about the value of what they are being given, just as paying
customers often fail to predict their degree of satisfaction
accurately. So the effect of error, when we compare these two
different arrangements, can be discounted. What remains is
that potential gap of £15 in perceived value.</p>

<p>What the above contrast demonstrates is
that whereas business is an inherently efficient activity,
charity is inherently wasteful. I&#39;m not saying that all
business endeavour is efficient, nor that all charitable
endeavour is worthless. What I am saying is that the
contrasting pressures of business and charity are arranged to
encourage such a contrast. Tradesmen must sell their products
to customers whose payments must more than cover the cost of
the service. Therefore tradesmen are all the time being
pressurised into using their raw materials and efforts in a
way that is more than compensated for by the satisfaction
produced by the outcome. But charitable producers need only
start to worry seriously if they produce services that are
literally so worthless to their &quot;customers&quot; that
those customers consider the products in question to be
overpriced at zero.</p>

<p>Despite - and also because of - this gulf
that is fixed between trade and charity, charities tend to
measure their effectiveness by measuring the amount of money
that they spend, rather than by trying independently to
measure the value of what they have done. One routinely hears
charities announcing that they have distributed X million
pounds worth&quot; of aid in this or that worthy and
catastrophic circumstance, when all they are really reporting
is that they have spent X million pounds.</p>

<p>This is understandable. The people who
donate all the money do not like to think about their money
being routinely squandered. They too, just like the charities
they give money to, like to think that in spending ten pounds
they have automatically done ten pounds worth of good. Yet it
simply is not so. There is simply no regular pressure pushing
in that direction, and an inexorably regular pressure pushing
in a quite different direction.</p>

<p>A ten pound donation may do ten pounds
worth of good. It may, come to that, do a hundred pounds
worth of good, in this or that particular circumstance. But
once again, the same can be said of businesses which sell
goods which their customers would happily pay far more for,
which happens constantly.</p>

<p>I repeat, it is in the very nature of
charity that the thing should tend towards wastefulness, just
as it is inherently in the nature of business that it must
tend towards not being wasteful if it is to stay in business.
This is no mere incidental problem that charities are
grappling with, which can be solved by replacing this charity
worker by that one, this technique of distribution by that
one, or by putting some worthier people than before on the
writing paper. &quot;Charity&quot; is an inherently dodgy way
of getting things done.</p>

<p>The steel magnate Andrew Carnegie made a
vast fortune in nineteenth century America, and this fortune
was then spent on what Carnegie hoped would be good works in
the twentieth century world. There is no doubt at all in my
mind that Andrew Carnegie did far more good for humanity
making his money than he ever did spending it. <a href=
"#N2">[2]</a> One of the great disasters of the twentieth
century has been that honestly and creatively earned
nineteenth century fortunes have been posthumously spent
denouncing capitalism and promoting every sort of tyranny and
stupidity.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Trade is Very Helpful but Very
Specialised</font></b></p>

<p>What is it about charity that makes it
seem so helpful, and why does trade, which actually is so
helpful, seem so unhelpful by comparison?</p>

<p>Part of the answer, I suspect, is that
trade is typically very specialised. A firm which makes
toilet rolls by the million is plainly being helpful to a
vast number of people, but it isn&#39;t being all that
helpful to any one of that vast number. Although the total
quantity of help being spread around is huge, no one person
who uses the toilet paper is having his life utterly
transformed for the better, especially when you consider that
each toilet roll customer could get toilet rolls almost as
good and perhaps better from someone else.</p>

<p>Success is dull. Success is the churning
out of small answers to small problems on a colossal scale.
You bite off what you can chew, and then you chew. Being
genuinely helpful in a big way is basically machine minding.
You set up a system that does the job, and then you see to it
that it keeps on doing it. How much more glamorous and
elevating than such humble effectiveness is the process of
merely grappling ineffectively with large dollops of misery.
How much more morally uplifting it is to fail to cure someone
of cancer, than to succeed in making and selling crate after
crate of well designed toilet rolls. Yet in the matter of
which does more good, there is no doubt that the toilet rolls
win by a knockout.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Hell Hath No Fury Like a Do-Gooder
Scorned</font></b></p>

<p>People who work for charities like to
suppose that the explanation of their frequently very drab
and unbusinesslike surroundings is they are &quot;avoiding
waste&quot;. But just as likely is that they are simply
avoiding work. They don&#39;t have to be efficient, to run a
tight ship, to chase costs, to communicate very effectively
with their &quot;customers&quot; or even with each other, and
all too often they don&#39;t. Above all, there is no
automatic pressure upon charity workers to use their time
efficiently, especially if they are donating that time free
of charge. Just as is the case with the recipients of charity
who pay nothing for what they get, those who get paid nothing
for their &quot;work&quot; merely have to be better than completely
useless.</p>

<p>Hell hath no fury like a voluntary worker
accused of laziness or incompetence. Dare to make such
accusations and you will be assailed with great gobs of
information concerning how much time and effort the worker in
question is consuming. To reply in such circumstances that
the time and the effort is not in doubt, merely whether it is
achieving anything, is to be greeted by sulks and tantrums of
all kinds. The wise charity manager takes whatever he or she
is offered without complaint, and seeks to improve upon it
only with extreme tactfulness.</p>

<p>This tendency of charity workers to be
extremely polite to one another, until the black moment
arrives when charity worker A considers charity worker B to
be worse than useless, might account for the truly
spectacular rows that so often erupt in the world of charity.
Tradesmen argue with each other about whether they are worth
their salaries. Such argument is frequent, but on the whole
relatively low key. Charity workers say nothing, until they
consider each other to be doing an actual minus quantity, at
which point the proverbial waste matter can really hit the
fan. Charity worker B thought he was doing X hours of
colossal good, but suddenly it emerges - with no warning -
that charity worker A reckons charity worker B to have being
doing X hours of harm! Without doubt, the most vicious public
row that I have ever personally witnessed in my entire life
occurred at the annual general meeting, some years back, of
that model of saintly beneficence, Amnesty International.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Charity and Crime</font></b></p>

<p>Charity and crime are not the same thing.
Morally they are absolutely distinct. But what they both have
in common is that the receivers on the one hand of charity
and on the other of loot are in neither case giving much
thought to what they might give to the world in exchange for
what the world is giving them. Criminals after easy pickings
naturally gravitate towards charity, as and when it is about.
Charity, in other words, and just like crime, feeds the
non-productive and lowers the relative status and strength of
the productive. It empowers - to use that very nineties word
- the criminal poor in their battles against their most
typical victims, the productive poor.</p>

<p>This pattern is acted out on the streets
of London, where criminals have moved in on London&#39;s
thriving beggary business in recent years. It is acted out on
a bigger and more tragic scale in the Third World where
entire countries have become the possessions of criminal
gangs, who live off aid from richer countries. A great deal
more thought would go into the question of productive
enterprise in such places, if preying upon that was the main
source of income for the gangs in charge. As it is,
potentially very profitable industries are wrecked without a
second thought, either by direct thieving, or else by the
local state setting up rival enterprises paid for by foreign
donors, which derange local markets and divert scarce local
resources into fatuous fantasy projects. <a href=
"#N3">[3]</a></p>

<p>Libertarians routinely denounce the
foreign aid racket in just these terms, but often fail to
realise that the most important part of their argument - the
bit that describes the harm that aid does at the far end -
applies just as forcefully to &quot;charity&quot; as it does to the
enforced charity that is foreign aid.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Charity Work as a Free
Sample</font></b></p>

<p>Why then does &quot;charity&quot; persist?</p>

<p>The answer is that charity is not all
stupidity. It is something much more difficult to restrain,
and for that reason much more harmful, namely a sensible way
of behaving that has got out of hand. Just as charity and
crime have a way of merging into each other, so, in a morally
opposite setting, do charity and trade.</p>

<p>Anyone who waits for the world to do him
favours before doing any in exchange is liable to face a long
wait.</p>

<p>Take my case. The desktop publishing I do
for the Libertarian Alliance is on the face of it a classic
case of a charity worker giving it away, but as with many
other charity workers, my motives are by no means so sordidly
altruistic as they might appear. I am giving the world a free
sample. I now have several real customers who first learned
of my prowess as a DTP person by learning that I do the
LA&#39;s publications.</p>

<p>If you are unemployed and getting
desperate, you could do a lot worse than scrounge a
non-paying job in your local Oxfam shop. True, you will be
contributing to a deeply flawed enterprise, but you will at
least have the chance to demonstrate that you are a capable
worker, assuming that this is what you are. Work well and you
might then get a proper job, doing something of genuine
benefit to your fellow earth dwellers. The boss of the shop
may be a bearded idiot who is wasting his life, but perhaps
he has a sister with shoulder pads who is doing something
valuable like working on the Stock Exchange and who is
seeking capable menials to assist her, and the bearded idiot
can at least do the world one favour by making that
connection for you. Also, if you work in an Oxfam shop you
will learn things, about stock control, about shoplifters,
about the appallingness of Oxfam, and about life generally.
<a href="#N4">[4]</a></p>

<p>The same principle is followed by ageing
rock stars, who remind us that they haven&#39;t yet died and
still have something to offer by donating their performances
free of charge at charity concerts. Other performances are
donated by artists who are just starting out in show
business. This is one of the few unreservedly helpful things
achieved by these events.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Favours</font></b></p>

<p>Closely related to the matter of free
samples is the process of doing favours. Whereas samples are
scattered about like seeds, favours are targeted precisely at
the favoured individual.</p>

<p>All successful and effective people
understand the art of doing favours, and of receiving them.
The rules are simple. For a favour to be make sense it has to
be (a) very easy to give while at the same time being (b)
very helpful to receive. For a relationship involving favours
to last, the favoured person must understand that a favour is
what is being done, and be ready at some future point to do a
return favour which is similarly easy for him to do and
similarly useful to his original benefactor.</p>

<p>A typical favour is for you to lend or
give to someone very poor what is to you a trivial sum of
money but is to him an enormous convenience. Poverty being a
relative matter most of us constantly both receive and bestow
this particular favour. A fractionally more creative favour
might be - I don&#39;t know - that I do some free desktop
publishing for someone who is skint but - it later emerges -
an excellent conversationalist, and she later agrees to
attend one of my last-Friday-of-the-month intellectual
soirees for which I fear a thin turnout (with me perhaps even
paying for her tube ticket). You might, via your
sister-in-law the production assistant, arrange for me to do
my libertarian mouthing off act on television, and I might in
exchange put you in touch with someone who can fix you a
fascinating job in an exotic foreign country. Your father who
edits The Times might be persuaded to take me out to dinner
and to commission half a dozen articles on libertarian themes
from me, and I might in exchange agree to take your wearisome
(to you but not to me) girlfriend off your hands and to a
succession of Promenade Concerts.</p>

<p>I do the Libertarian Alliance the favour
of publishing its products, and the Libertarian Alliance in
return allows me to advertise my various other projects and
preoccupations.</p>

<p>Effective and happy people are always on
the lookout for favours like this, that they can do for
others and that others can do for them, and they understand
the meaning of the statement &quot;I owe you one&quot;, both when
they say it and when it is said to them.</p>

<p>Owing someone a favour does not mean that
you then have to lend them thirty thousand pounds that you
don&#39;t have, or donate to them one of your scarce bodily
organs that you would far rather hang on to. As I say,
favours must not be a big minus for the giver; that isn&#39;t
how it works. When someone demands a big sacrifice from you,
merely because you owe them a small one, tell them: no. If it
will help, quote this.</p>

<p>Best of all, and in complete contrast to
any notion of you making a big sacrifice, is when what you do
for someone else in exchange for the favour he&#39;s done you
is actually good for you, as well as being excellent for him.
(My definition of &quot;compromise&quot;: in exchange for you
doing something I want, I do something else I want.)</p>

<p>For example if I fix you a job via my
friend with the foreign connections and you do the job well,
that is good for me as well as for you, because I&#39;ve done
my friend a favour, which is to my advantage (because then he
owes me one). The free desktopping I do for you might double
up as a free sample of my prowess which you can show to your
colleagues at work, which might well be you doing them a
favour as well as me. The lady who is badgered into attending
my soiree may thoroughly enjoy it. (If she isn&#39;t likely
to enjoy it, then it wouldn&#39;t be much of a favour to me
for her to come to it and I wouldn&#39;t ask her to.)
<a href="#N5">[5]</a></p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Trade, Favours and
Friendship</font></b></p>

<p>Giving and receiving favours is closely
connected with telling people clearly what you are good at
and are easily able and happy to do for them, and what you
value and are eager to receive from them in exchange. The
trouble with &quot;altruists&quot; is that they never tell
you what they want, because they consider it immoral even to
think about this. And they never listen when you tell them
what you want because, because they consider themselves so
morally elevated compared to you that they know better.
Altruists give you only what they decide you need&quot;.
Selfish people make far better associates. In the ancient and
time honoured phrase, you know where you are with them.
<a href="#N6">[6]</a></p>

<p>The connection between the favours system
and trade is pretty clear. The difference is merely that
trade means favours paid for in cash, either straight away or
soon afterwards via a legally binding contract. The usual
anti-capitalist sneer against trade is that it has nothing to
do with generosity. Trade is all grab, grab, grab. Not so.
Trade and the favours system merge into each other. Both are
exercises in rational egoism. Value in exchange for value.
Both involve careful thought about what will be truly helpful
to others. <a href="#N7">[7]</a></p>

<p>The proof of the benevolence embodied in
trade is how often trade mutates into friendship. What
happens is that to begin with every thing is carefully
calculated, and all favours this way and that are carefully
paired together. But eventually you each do so well out of
the relationship that you both say: to hell with all these
calculations, we&#39;re friends. We&#39;ll each do whatever
is needed by the other, and to hell with the prices.
Let&#39;s cut out all further calculation costs by simply
ceasing to calculate. (And that, of course, where the trouble
can start, because central to the art of keeping your friends
is the habit of continuing to calculate, that is, of
continuing to tell them what you will and won&#39;t do for
them, and what they can and needn&#39;t do for you.)</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Charity as a Chain of
Favours</font></b></p>

<p>So, generosity - albeit of a somewhat
egoistic and calculating sort is a fact of a life and a
sensible one. What does this mean for
&quot;charity&quot;?</p>

<p>First, it means that you aren&#39;t ever
going to get rid of charity entirely, and that you
shouldn&#39;t even want to, because some charities are only
very slightly developed versions of the favours system have
just described. The connection between the favours system and
charity is, I think, clear. Each involves giving something of
value to another with no definite promise of anything in
exchange.</p>

<p>The point where the favours system mutates
most definitely into charity is when more than two people are
involved in trading the favours. If B owes A (or is willing
to owe A) a favour, and if C owes B (or is willing to owe B)
a favour, then all is ready for C to do A a favour, even if C
and A have never met. From this to rattling a tin in the high
street is but a very short step. One of the best ways of
giving charity is to give it not to some victim of
underdevelopment&quot; five thousand miles away, but to give
it as a tangible favour to the actual person - with whom you
are personally acquainted - who is rattling the tin under
your nose. And then next month she can sell pantomime tickets
for you, or whatever.</p>

<p>If everybody followed this rule charity
would still flourish, and of course lots of charity does
flourish on exactly this sensible and civilised basis. If
everyone involved in such a charity is being properly selfish
and calculating, then it follows that someone some- where is
looking at all those &quot;victims&quot; of whatever the hell
it is, in the same calculating, canny and above all
knowledgeable way that I look at you when I&#39;m sizing you
up as a potential associate. And that is how it should be.
This decade&#39;s flood victim could be the next decade&#39;s
business partner, and if that is how things turn out then you
really will have done him a favour.</p>

<p>The thing that people generally moan about
when they speak of &quot;aid&quot; is that it is all mixed up
with &quot;trade&quot;, and that most &quot;aid&quot; seems
to have &quot;strings&quot; attached to it. Often these
strings are indeed appalling. In exchange for the stupidity
of &quot;aid&quot;, the victims of the aid must in addition
involve themselves in something else that is equally stupid,
like adopting daft statist economic policies. But if it
really is trade, and the &quot;victims&quot; in question
really do end up making a contribution to whatever gets going
- that is, if they cease to be victims - and are not merely
standing around while foreigners erect meaningless concrete
structures all over them and screw up their water supplies,
then that&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>A classic case of a well timed favour is
local disaster relief. This is when a basically sensible
bunch of people, usually quite able to look after themselves,
find themselves temporarily flooded out or bombed or
otherwise deranged and their neighbours chip in with the
necessary help, just until the people with the problem find
their feet again, and on the dear understanding that they
would and will do the same for their rescuers if that need
ever arises. A couple of nights&#39; free board and lodging,
one journey in a well stocked car, or just a strategically
timed shoulder to cry on, these are the kinds of favours that
all sane and sensible people are ready to do in such
circumstances, and thus it will always be. Quite a lot of
charity is only a slightly blown-up version of this, and as
such it is sensible.</p>

<p>But let me be pedantic about it and say
why it is sensible. It is sensible because, in the case of
temporary disasters to people like ourselves, we have a very
exact idea of what help will actually be truly helpful, and
because most of us are sensible enough not to go overboard
and give more than is convenient to us. We donate spare
blankets if we&#39;ve got them, but we don&#39;t make fools
of ourselves by going out and actually buying blankets. We
take in four temporary lodgers for two nights, but not forty
for a month. But, when you consider the predicaments being
suffered by far away people of whom we know little, the
arithmetic is far less likely to work out. For example, the
difficulties of the people of Ethiopia are a very complex
matter, so far as I am concerned, and I am reluctant to part
with anything on their behalf. What if the people collecting
the money know no more about the Ethiopians than I do? What
if they know less? What if they give their &quot;aid&quot;
not to the starving folk of Ethiopia, but instead to one of
Ethiopia&#39;s not quite so starving armies, and what if this
invigorated army then goes on another murdering spree?</p>

<p>Insofar as Ethiopian disaster relief does
still involve the rational exchange of favours, these are
likely to spread out along a very long chain. There&#39;ll be
an awful lot of room for miscalculation.</p>

<p>I am not alone in thinking like this. As
any tabloid editor knows, their readers need to be able to
&quot;relate&quot; to whoever is being collected for, and
quite right too. To recycle another piece of ancient wisdom,
charity begins at home. And judging from recent charitable
excesses it would be a good thing if most of it ended at home
as well.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Charity, Guilt and the Fixed Quantity
of Wealth Fallacy</font></b></p>

<p>A common answer to anticharitable
sentiments like mine is that I am a selfish middle class
bastard and am merely excusing my extreme selfishness. I
disagree. I am being selfish, and I see no need to excuse
this, but I also think I&#39;m being sensible. It is commonly
said of the middle classes that their relative lack of
generosity to good causes is evidence of their moral
inferiority compared to the lower classes, who are said by
some to be much more generous with good causes than are their
economic superiors. Again I dissent. Partly, the willingness
of the poor to give money to help other poor people is
sensible, because they presumably understand the problems of
poor people elsewhere better than richer people do. But
mostly I consider the charitable reflexes of so many poor
people to be evidence not of their generosity but of their
stupidity, which might also account for why they are
poor.</p>

<p>When I read out the above paragraph at a
discussion evening based upon this piece, it was greeted with
vehement disagreement. The middle classes, said one
particular objector, give just as much in percentage terms to
charity as the poor, and this, he said, was because of middle
class guilt.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not concerned here with the
question of which particular class is - in empirical fact -
being silliest about giving money to charity. If richer
people give money to charity because they feel bad about
being rich, that&#39;s a different matter from poor people
giving money away and consequently staying poor. Without
wanting to worry about how widespread it is, I&#39;d say that
guilt about being rich is rooted in the fixed quantity of
wealth fallacy. The fixed quantity of wealth fallacy asserts
that the only way for any person to get rich is for some
other person or persons to get less rich. So if you persist
in remaining rich, you are causing poverty, and chucking that
gold sovereign out of your carriage window is the logical way
to lessen your guilt. Poorer people who give excessively to
charity - to help those even poorer than they are - are
probably also in the grip of this same assumption.</p>

<p>The only thing I really want to say here
about the fixed quantity of wealth fallacy is that it is
indeed a fallacy. Helping others does not necessarily involve
harming yourself. Wealth is creatable. To acquire it, you do
not have to steal or beg it from others. lf others are to get
it, they need not steal or beg it from you. We can make
wealth, and swap the wealth we&#39;ve made with each other,
in exchange for the other kinds of wealth others have
made.</p>

<p>And we can destroy wealth. A good example
of which is a thoughtless and wasteful charitable donation,
as a result of which the giver deprives him or herself of
more than the receiver receives.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Could Oxfam Become a Respectable
Business?</font></b></p>

<p>I said some harsh words about Oxfam in an
earlier paragraph. But let me now say something nice about
this enterprise.</p>

<p>Obviously, the most admirable thing about
Oxfam so far as I am concerned is that it sells me cheap
clothing. Despite my fears about where the money will go and
the misery it will cause, I am happy recently to have parted
with £16 for a suit, when I compare that with what I would
have had to pay for the same thing at Burton&#39;s. An
obvious improvement would be for Oxfam to pay something for
the items that are given to them, instead of expecting people
just to donate unwanted items. I have another suit that is
now too small for me, but I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;ll give
it to Oxfam for nothing, for them to sell it to some
emaciated leftist and for the resulting money to be spent
deranging Third World agricultural markets. On the other
hand, if they offered me a fiver for my suit, or merely five
pounds&#39; worth of other purchases, I&#39;d accept. I&#39;d
also shop at Oxfam a lot more, because there&#39;d be lots
more produce to choose from if this was how they did
things.</p>

<p>But the really good news about Oxfam is
that there is starting to be a thoroughly healthy air of
neo-colonialism about the enterprise. I browse around my
local Oxfam shop, and - although I could be imagining this -
I think I smell actual money being made - being earned - by
former victims. I detect the definite aroma of cheap Third
World labour being shamelessly exploited to create trinkets
for the Volvo driving segment of the British middle classes.
<a href="#N8">[8]</a> There are ethnic garments, and ethnic
carvings, and ethnic musical instruments, and ethnic rugs,
ethnic boxes and containers, ethnic dolls and ethnic
Christmas cards, all for outrageously ethnic prices. Soon it
will be ethnic sparking plugs and ethnic CD players. Although
I do not favour ethnic produce myself, I entirely approve of
this trend.</p>

<p>Ten years ago it used to be nothing but
puzzles with bits missing, dead standard lamps, clapped out
gramophones and so forth, and a generally drab, dusty and
dilapidated air to match. But now the place is much smarter,
like a real shop. Eventually the ethnic exploitation
department will start to realise that all the Bolshevik
propaganda Oxfam also emits is silly next to this exuberant
capitalist exploitation, and - or so I like to fantasise -
they&#39;ll sling the bolshevism out. In a hundred years time
the Oxfam shops may have improved to the point where they
will be a genuine one-hundred-per- cent
exploit-the-hell-out-of-everyone-especially-ethnics business,
and they&#39;ll be bounced around the City for thousands of
millions of pounds, just like a real business. If so Oxfam
won&#39;t be the first scumbag charity that finally got its
act together and started doing nothing but good, because
history is full of them. You start by doing some people some
favours, and then you get the thing properly organised and
you really start doing people favours. <a href=
"#N9">[9]</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t of course know if this is the
way Oxfam will move, but I&#39;m sure there are at least some
people within it who would fully understand what I am saying,
and justify their present activities in my terms rather than
their own usual ones. They are setting Third World farmers up
in self supporting business, not running them out of it, and
so forth. Some of them may even be prepared to argue, against
what I take to be the prevailing prejudices of the bulk of
the Oxfam workforce, that if the rich countries really wanted
to help the poor countries then rich countries would scrap
the tariff barriers and quota restrictions they now erect
against poor countries, such as the infamous &quot;multifibre
agreement&quot;, and such as the appalling barriers the
Common Market places in the path of cheap foreign food.
Piling &quot;aid&quot; on top of a country while
simultaneously refusing to do honest business with it is a
spectacularly evil combination of policies.</p>

<p>In general, everyone involved in a charity
should be trying to work out how the enterprise could
function as a serious business. After all, if someone is
truly being helped, two things ought to follow. One, they
ought to be genuinely grateful, through having been done
genuine favours. Two, thus favoured, and by the definition of
a favour, they should have become people who are better able
to return favours. If not you haven&#39;t been doing them
much of a favour, merely attaching them to your drip-feed
system and making them dependent upon it. Many of my
pro-free-market friends write pamphlets about how charities
shouldn&#39;t be involved in politics. But the problem is not
the fact of charities being active in politics; it is the
sort of politics they are active in. Arguing that charities
should merely do less harm is surely to miss the point.
<a href="#N10">[10]</a></p>

<p><b><font size="+1">In Praise of Casual
Labour</font></b></p>

<p>But if &quot;charity&quot; is not the
answer for the massed ranks of the world&#39;s poorest and
most unfortunate, what is?</p>

<p>As I say, the answer is trade. But not
trade as it is usually spoken of. Above all, not merely
&quot;jobs&quot;, if by a job is meant the person doing the
job promising to stick at it for the next several months, and
the employer agreeing to pay out several thousand pounds on
the off chance that the person doing the &quot;job&quot; will
actually be contributing something. This is a far too rigid
way to talk.</p>

<p>But suppose that by a &quot;job&quot; you
mean something like: Hey, kid, there&#39;s a fiver for you if
you deliver this letter, now, to my mate twenty minutes walk
from here, and if you bring back what he gives you that
I&#39;ve just asked him for on my portable. And there&#39;s
another fiver if you are back here for more in twenty
minutes, i.e. kid, if you run. GO!!!&quot; That&#39;s the
sort of risk a person might be willing to take on a dubious
looking teenager he&#39;s never seen before, because if it
goes wrong it&#39;s no big disaster, but if he finds himself
a useful servant then it&#39;s a big plus. Once you see work
as something that is continuously negotiated, continuously
done in small gobs, and continuously paid for - once you see
it, in other words - and to use a disastrously misleading and
impoverishing word - as &quot;casual&quot; - then you are in
the proper frame of mind to start getting it and to start
doing it. One of the saddest aspects of the Struggle for the
Rights of the Working Man in recent decades is that
&quot;casual&quot; work has been rubbished. Instead,
proletarians have been encouraged to stand around announcing
that they have a right to work - to a &quot;job&quot;, that
is - to which the inevitable response from the
fiver-flaunting classes has been to say that they have a
right to ignore these useless parasites.</p>

<p>Now your average bearded Oxfam helper
might well say at this point that &quot;people ought not to
have to live like that&quot;. But the best way for people to
get themselves real jobs complete with Volvos and suits is in
the meantime for there to be an abundance of the kind of jobs
I have just described. How else can the lowest of the lower
classes prove their worth to their fellow men. How else can
they prove their ability to keep their promises, repay
favours, and generally behave like straight-up people. Making
casual work illegal, by such devices as minimum wage laws and
ludicrously restrictive safety regulations, is a complete
disaster for the poor, because it destroys the first few
rungs of the economic ladder. It guarantees that millions
will be permanently left off that ladder, with nothing left
but to seek out welfare, to beg for charity or to become
thieves.</p>

<p>Once you see a &quot;job&quot; as
something you do now, in the next half an hour, you also
realise that all of those allegedly useless and hopeless
people who will supposedly die without the welfare state have
almost all of them got something to offer. Hey, granny, watch
the barrow while I go see Billy, I&#39;ll see you right,
don&#39;t attack any robbers, just try to get a look at their
faces.&quot; &quot;Jason, you educationally subnormal wanker,
get in here and sweep this floor, or no supper tonight.&quot;
&quot;Kylie, keep an eye on Jason, would you, and while
you&#39;re about it, see if you can mend that sign.&quot;
Jobs. Even the lowliest of us can usually manage something
along these lines. Those formerly poor countries which have
got rich in recent decades, and given everyone suits to wear
and regular years-at-a-time jobs to do, have been the ones
where this sort of &quot;casual&quot; economic activity has
been allowed rather than forbidden. The disaster areas have
been where anti-capitalistic despots have tried to abolish
poverty by making illegal the jobs that poor people are
actually able to get and to do. <a href="#N11">[11]</a></p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Technology Exploits the Poor and
Incompetent Better</font></b></p>

<p>The other great boon bestowed upon the
poor and the unfortunate by rip-roaring unrestrained
capitalism has been technology, which has created a hurricane
of casual jobs for all populations of upwardly mobile paupers
who are not forbidden to do them. Surveillance cameras
require middle aged farts, who have ruled themselves out of
more lucrative military service by eating too much junk food,
to gawp at TV screens - this at least they do know how to do
- and to alert their younger and more vigorous colleagues,
who love fighting but are unreliable at merely keeping an eye
on things. Portable phones and calculators and computers
enable sedentary and cerebral idlers like me to sit at a desk
and chum out paperwork of all kinds, which creates further
activity for low-IQ drudges who are needed to shift all the
piles of paper this way and that. If half the street
criminals of the western world&#39;s inner cities were simply
hired for a pittance and given cheap Japanese video cameras
to spy on the other half, that would slash the crime rate
instantaneously.</p>

<p>This can&#39;t happen properly until crime
prevention is denationalised, which is another pamphlet. From
this point of view, the privatisation of &quot;public&quot; space
is probably the best thing that could happen to very low IQ
people, because they would then get badly paid - but paid -
jobs, pounding the beat, seeing fair play, and generally
showing the flag on behalf of the owners of the public spaces
in question.</p>

<p>But none of this can happen if the reward
for hiring someone for twenty minutes is to be had up in
front of a tribunal of hyper-educated idiots and punished for
not having any more work immediately available at the end of
the twenty minutes in question.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">The Disaster of the Welfare
State</font></b></p>

<p>Ironically, I find myself in agreement
with welfare statists when they say that &quot;charity is not
enough&quot;. However their objection to charity is that it
tends towards the favours system, and that at a certain
moment the donors start calling in their favours. Welfare
statists prefer the welfare state to charity, because that
way the paupers have a right to what they get, and no
obligations of any sort in return. Given that welfare
statists may accordingly be attracted to an attack on
charity, and that they may now have read this far even though
they don&#39;t like what I&#39;m saying, because the money
has now been spent, I will now briefly summarise the
libertarian case against the welfare state. This is now
fairly familiar stuff, I&#39;m glad to say, but it is so
important and so true that it will bear endless repetition.
<a href="#N12">[12]</a></p>

<p>The case for the welfare state would be a
lot less far beneath contempt if welfare states actually did
look after all the useless and miserable people they are
supposed to look after. As with so many arguments, what we
usually get in this one is a comparison between an imaginary
welfare state and real capitalism - of the sort that has been
utterly deranged by pro-welfare-state fanatics - instead of a
fair contest. The reality of welfare states is that they hire
an ever growing hoard of potentially quite self-supporting
people to be useless and pathetic, and then the taxpayers
eventually decide that this is silly (as it most certainly
is) and the flow of money (instead of increasing
exponentially, as it must if the ever increasing numbers of
the useless and the pathetic are to continue being looked
after) ceases and the now multitudinous useless and pathetic
proceed literally to starve to death (given that the laws
against poor people doing anything useful tend to remain on
the books). And since this abomination can only occur in a
country rich enough to afford such idiocies in the first
place (poor countries are spared welfare states, unless
interfering foreigners insist on creating them), welfare
states end up creating extremes of poverty and wealth such as
used only to be fantasised about in rabidly anti-capitalist
pamphlets. Charming. Absolutely charming. Seriously, this
horror is happening in my own country, right now. <a href=
"#N13">[13]</a></p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Can the Libertarian Paradigm Answer all
Questions?</font></b></p>

<p>At that discussion evening I referred to
above, when someone objected about how the middle classes are
even sillier than poor people about giving to charity,
someone else got even more heated about question of the
terminally ill. Terminally ill people, he said, can&#39;t run
errands.</p>

<p>True, I replied, but would it not be
valuable if rather more thought was given to the question of
what they can do than is customary nowadays. Just because
someone is doomed to die quite soon does not mean that he is
completely useless in the meantime. How can we exploit the
terminally ill? That is the question. Technology can surely
contribute something, in the form of cheap communications
devices that oldies stretched out on their death beds can
still use. Baby minding? Moral instruction of the not quite
infantile? Watching all those video cameras set up in
privately owned streets (the hi-tech equivalent of spying
through lace curtains)? My point is not so much that I have
any very specific answers to this question of how to make
better use of really ill people, but that so few people even
bother to ask the question.</p>

<p>I absolutely deny, by the way, that this
is a callous and cruel way to think. On the contrary, the
thing that oldies complain about most ferociously is
precisely that they are treated as useless, even when they
clearly aren&#39;t. Asking how to exploit the very
unexploitably old will at least heave this particular
pendulum in the right direction.</p>

<p>The proof of my rightness in this argument
will come when the baby boomers all become very old, a moment
that is rapidly approaching. As usual the baby boomers will
have disproportionate power. But they won&#39;t demand bigger
state pensions, because the money won&#39;t be there. Instead
they will demand the right to go on earning into their old
age, while still collecting their smaller pensions. Both
economy and dignity will converge upon the idea of the
exploitation of the old, even of the dying. But I agree,
probably not by delivering messages on roller-skates.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Yes</font></b></p>

<p>The other point being made by my critic
who was worried about the plight of the very old was that we
libertarians mustn&#39;t fall into the trap of saying we have
all the answers&quot;. Well, maybe we don&#39;t have all the
answers, but we have a hell of a lot more answers than anyone
else does. Charity and the welfare state are both a disaster
by comparison with total economic liberty. And, insofar as
some brain-dead, comatose, cancer-ridden, HIV positive, deaf,
dumb, blind, limbless and uninsured unfortunates will indeed
be utterly dependent upon the uncalculating generosity of
others, then just as important as whether anyone wants to
help such persons is whether those who do want to help can.
The very enthusiasm with which the welfare state idea is
persisted with by millions of otherwise sane and humane
people is evidence of their concern for the helpless, which
in a libertarian world would have to be expressed
differently.</p>

<p>The big difference between now and the
alternative libertarian utopia is that in the latter there
would be far more wealth spread around for people to give
away to this hapless minority. I am completely confident that
such extreme unfortunates would, in a libertarian world, (a)
be rarer (e.g. because they&#39;d been encouraged to save and
insure for a rainy day - and also not to get so damaged in
the first place) and (b) be much better looked after than
they are now, at the very bottom of the welfare heap and at
the very end of the welfare queue. In short, insofar as
anyone has all the answers&quot;, then we do.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">The Burning Lift</font></b></p>

<p>In the end, this argument about what
happens to the very, very unfortunate ends up as a variant of
what I refer to as the &quot;burning lift question&quot;. The
burning lift question is asked by somebody at every meeting I
ever address about the virtues of libertarianism and the
horrors of welfare states, and it goes like this. Supposing
you are stuck in a lift on the eighteenth floor of a burning
skyscraper, and the local fire brigade is busy with a bomb
scare on the other side of town, and in any case only has
ladders that will reach up to the twelfth floor of your
tower, and supposing in addition that three or four other
disasters are simultaneously occurring each bad enough to
kill you even without a fire ... What then??????? What will
libertarianism do to save you then question mark question
mark?? Always, worded one way or another, someone asks this.
The answer is nothing. You will die.</p>

<p>If you are deaf, dumb, blind, etc., and
lacking in any concerned friends or relatives or welfare
states to take care of you, then I&#39;m afraid your
prospects are indeed severely constrained. You have problems,
and you almost certainly won&#39;t solve them.</p>

<p>In a libertarian world, your friends and
relatives will be richer, the welfare state won&#39;t exist
and will therefore be spreading no havoc and telling no lies,
and there may be new and splendid Japanese gadgets for
correcting your damaged brain and impaired senses, but the
principle remains. If you have completely insoluble and
totally fatal problems, then by definition you&#39;ve had
it.</p>

<p>Libertarianism does not mean that in a
libertarian world people will have no problems. It merely
asserts that a libertarian world is the best setting which
reality offers (as opposed to the fantasies of welfare
statists) within which people can attempt - perhaps
successfully and perhaps not - to solve their problems. After
all, in a libertarian world, many projects will be attempted
that in a non libertarian world would be unimaginable, and
that means that a libertarian world will, among many other
happier things, contain newer and bigger disasters. You
cannot, after all, have aeroplane disasters if there are no
aeroplanes.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Summary</font></b></p>

<p>To summarise my argument:</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>Charity has a built-in tendency to be
    downright harmful.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>But you can&#39;t entirely eradicate
    it, because sometimes it resembles trade, and can thus be
    a fine thing, or at any rate become a fine thing...</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>... because trade is a fine thing,
    especially when the very poor and very miserable are also
    allowed to do it in the exhausting and demeaning ways
    that they must.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Although trade doesn&#39;t solve all
    problems, the defects of trade pale into insignificance
    besides the defects of the welfare state method of
    tending to human catastrophe. Welfare states are started
    to stop catastrophes and end up being catastrophes on a
    far bigger scale.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><b><font size="+1">Helping People is
Difficult</font></b></p>

<p>To put the above summary even more simply,
I think that what this argument is about is the question of
what stops people helping each other.</p>

<p>The protagonists both of charity and of
the welfare state, it seems to me, are saying that helping
people is easy. What you have to do is simply do it. What is
scarce is the willingness to do it. If people don&#39;t now
help each other enough, this is because they are not being
nice enough. The answer is to sermonise at them until such
time as they see the wickedness of their selfish and grasping
ways and part with the necessary cash, either in the form of
voluntary donations or by voting for more taxes, to take care
of all the human disasters they now so cruelly ignore.
<a href="#N14">[14]</a></p>

<p>I say that helping people is difficult. To
help even a very small number of people - really to help them
and not just spray money or gifts at them - is a full-time
activity, and demands huge commitments of time and
intelligence. Also, given the complexities of human society,
it requires great learning in the ways of that society merely
to avoid making matters far worse, with projects which only
seem helpful but which are in fact enormously harmful. That
despite all of our best efforts huge human problems remain
does not prove that we are wicked. It merely proves how hard
human problems are to solve. <a href="#N15">[15]</a></p>

<p>I see that the TV journalist who sparked
off all the frenzied charitable activity a few years ago that
was aimed at Ethiopia, Michael Buerk of the BBC, is now
(early in 1992) cranking up another compassion orgy for
Somalia. That he means desperately well is beyond any shadow
of a doubt. Just what combination of good and evil will
result from his activities is impossible to predict. Not a
huge amount of either is my guess. The bitter pill that is so
hard to swallow in the unprecedentedly rich but no longer
all-powerful West is that these kinds of catastrophes (this
one is the result of civil war) are now beyond our capacity
to prevent. When we ruled Africa we could stop this kind of
thing, if we wanted to, and when not preoccupied with our own
wars. Now, if we seriously wanted to stop such horrors,
we&#39;d have to reconquer Africa. Maybe it will come to that.
But it is putting it very mildly indeed to say that such a
revival of imperialism would not guarantee an end to the
sufferings of people such as the hapless Somalians. Helping
people is difficult.</p>

<p>The best things I can do about the
sufferings of my fellow humans are, probably in this order:
(a) to do what favours I can for my friends and business
associates, as best I can, while simultaneously gathering in
favours, so that I continue to flourish (and to do favours)
in the future; and (b) to spread libertarian ideas to all who
can be persuaded to attend to them.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">The Libertarian Alliance is a
Charity</font></b></p>

<p>A final post-conclusion comment is worth
adding. I am uncomfortably aware that many of my strictures
about charity apply to the Libertarian Alliance itself, that
is, to project (b) above. In general, many of my remarks
about the unvirtuousness of charity are based upon critical
introspection. I am a somewhat lazy person. All my life I
have tended to prefer charitable work to the real thing, and
I know all about the temptation to describe this moral
failure as evidence of moral excellence.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the reasons you read so
little about the idiocy of charity is that the kind of
organisations that publish pieces like this one tend to be
semi or completely charitable organisations themselves. Very
probably the flier advertising this piece of writing to the
LA&#39;s subscribers will be accompanied by begging messages
of various sorts, on other bits of paper. I am, in other
words, still swimming languidly in the warm waters of charity
and of charitable self-congratulation. All I can say in my
defence is that I have given a lot of thought during recent
years to the economics of libertarianism. I have pondered how
I and my associates can run the libertarian enterprise
profitably instead of charitably, who wants it, why, and why
it makes sense for them to pay for it, and how, and how I can
find my way to fame and riches through being and having been
a libertarian, and so forth and so on. In other words the
advice I give to other charities, that they should try to
work themselves out of the charity business and into real
business, is advice I am trying to follow myself. <a href=

<p><b><font size="+1">Notes</font></b></p>

<p><a name="N1"></a> 1. We who preside over
the LA spend our lives nagging our writers to supply accurate
and complete footnotes. &quot;Somebody once said&quot;
isn&#39;t good enough, we keep telling them. Who? So who are
these libertarians, with their exaggeratedly pro-charity
notions? Murray Rothbard makes much of charity in &quot;For A
New Liberty&quot;, 2nd. edn., Collier Macmillan, New York,
1973 (there, that&#39;s how you do it people: author, title,
publisher, place of publication, date). However, I&#39;m
thinking more of novice libertarians of my personal
acquaintance, in conversation, and I suppose you could say
that these people are my target readership for this</p>

<p><a name="N2"></a> 2. I wrote this piece
without referring to any particular books, but I am aware
that several hooks in particular, and several writers in
general hovered over it, so to speak. I didn&#39;t look again
at these books before writing this, only to get information
about publishers for these footnotes. That giving money away
is less valuable in terms of its benefits to others than
doing business with it is an idea I recall as having been
most forcefully explained to me in Henry Hazlitt&#39;s
&quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot;, second revised edition,
Arlington House, New Rochelle, NY, 1979. For a brief account
of Andrew Carnegie&#39;s steel making achievements see
Jonathan Hughes, The Vital Few: American Economic Progress
and its Protagonists&quot; which I recall being entertained
by when I read it some years ago. My edition is the Oxford
University Press paperback of 1973. It was first published by
Houghton Mifflin in 1966.</p>

<p><a name="N3"></a> 3. For a searing and
bitter attack on &quot;aid&quot;, see Graham Hancock,
&quot;The Lords of Poverty&quot;, Macmillan, London, 1989. My
edition is the Mandarin paperback of 1991. The
subtitle/publisher&#39;s blurb on the front reads: &quot;The
freewheeling lifestyles, power, prestige and corruption of
the multibillion dollar aid business.&quot; I had long known
(e.g. by reading the works of P. T Bauer) that aid is a silly
and bad thing. See in particular Peter Bauer and Basil Yamey,
&quot;Against Foreign Aid&quot;, Economic Notes No. 23,
Libertarian Alliance, London, 1989. But until I read
Hancock&#39;s remarkable book I had no ides just how colossal
and colossally disgusting it is, and what complete shits many
aid &quot;experts&quot; are. Hanoock is adamant that aid
cannot be reformed. This would be like &quot;reforming&quot;
the slave trade. Aid is evil and must be abolished.</p>

<p><a name="N4"></a> 4. Charity work has
taught me plenty about how to be truly useful. Doing LA
graphics doesn&#39;t just advertise my desktop publishing
skills, for it was by doing the LA graphics that I learned
these skills in the first place. That no one was paying me,
and that I consequently only had at first to be better than
nothing at it was, to begin with, a great help.</p>

<p><a name="N5"></a> 5. For a &quot;game
theory&quot; - i.e. mathematically simplified but very
illuminating - discussion of the favours system see Robert
Axelrod, &quot;The Evolution of Cooperation&quot;, Basic
Books, New York, 1984.</p>

<p><a name="N6"></a> 6. The
characteristically libertarian argument about
&quot;selfishness&quot; (is Ayn Rand right in proposing
selfishness as a virtue - see &quot;The Virtue of
Selfishness&quot;, New American Library, New York, 1961 - or
is the general public right to regard it as a vice?) is
nicely illuminated by consideration of the favours system.
Rational or Randian selfishness means understanding the
favours system, spraying favours around, and as a result
receiving lots of favours in exchange. The more common usage
of the word &quot;selfish&quot; is to describe people who
receive or who expect to receive favours but who don&#39;t
reciprocate, to their short term advantage but to their long
term disadvantage.</p>

<p><a name="N7"></a> 7. For an
anthropologically angled discussion of the way that giving is
transmuted into &quot;trade&quot;, see George Gilder,
&quot;Wealth and Poverty&quot;, Basic Books, New York, 1981,
chapter 3, &quot;The Returns of Giving&quot;, especially pp.
23-30. Says Gilder (p. 34): &quot;Capitalism transforms the
gift impulse into a disciplined process of creative
investment based on a continuing analysis of the needs of
others.&quot; Gilder is, of course, a fierce opponent of
Rand&#39;s view of selfishness, and critical also of Adam
Smith.</p>

&quot;Exploitation&quot;, like &quot;selfishness&quot; is
another of those words with a double meaning. Its wicked
connotations are regularly used by libertarian tractmongers
like me to illuminate the fact that using people is a fine
thing if they consent to being used. The question is not: is
X being exploited? The question is: does X mind?
&quot;Exploitation&quot; suggests that X does mind, and the
word is then used to rubbish all forms of use of X by others,
i.e. civilisation itself.</p>

<p><a name="N9"></a> 9. Lest all of this
seems too optimistic, never forget that the recent
convulsions in the USSR began as an old fashioned exercise in
KGB sponsored bullshit. And then the windowdressing took over
the shop. The impression people are trying to give is at
least as important as any machinations they are trying to
conceal. See also my &quot;Why I Call Myself a Free Market
Anarchist and Why I am One,&quot; Political Notes No.67,
Libertarian Alliance, London, 1992.</p>

<p><a name="N10"></a> 10. See Freedom
Bulletin No. 6, March 1989, &quot;`A Multitude of Sins&#39;:
A Report on Left-Wing Abuse of Charities and Charitable
Status&quot;. I have ignored the matter of &quot;charitable
status&quot; in this piece, i.e: the British arrangement
which encourages taxpayers to spend on &quot;charities&quot;
rather than on more sensible things. Briefly, I think that every
organisation should have charitable status. Taxes on
everything should be lower, and in due course
non-existent.</p>

<p><a name="N11"></a> 11. I&#39;ve not read
Hernando de Soto&#39;s &quot;The Other Path: The Invisible
Revolution in the Third World&quot;, Harper & Row, New York,
1989, but I&#39;m told it contains opinions such as these,
about casual labour in the Third World, the idiocy of Big
Solutions to people&#39;s individual problems, and so
forth.</p>

<p><a name="N12"></a> 12. See Charles Murray,
&quot;The Emerging British Underclass&quot;, Institute of
Economic Affairs Health and Welfare Unit, London, 1990; and
Simon McIlwaine, The Disaster of the Welfare State&quot;,
Economic Notes No. 20, Libertarian Alliance, London,
1989.</p>

<p><a name="N13"></a> 13. See my
&quot;Another Attack on the Rent Acts&quot;, Political Notes
No. 60, Libertarian Alliance, London, 1992, for a slightly
more optimistic version of the same scenario. But will the
British electorate care enough about letting the paupers whom
they will soon have deprived of welfare switch to honest
work, given that the work will have to be done in amongst the
British electorate, and that the electorate will have to vote
in a government willing to relax the law against poor
people&#39;s work that now exist? Maybe not.</p>

<p><a name="N14"></a> 14. Charles
Murray&#39;s &quot;Losing Ground: American Social Policy
1950-1980&quot;, Basic Books, New York, 1984, is of course
one of the books which I read that made me think and write as
I do about &quot;welfare&quot;. Murray ends this book by
saying; &quot;When reforms finally do occur, they will happen
not because stingy people have won, but because generous
people have stopped kidding themselves.&quot; In other words
welfare is not a battle between good and bad people, but an
argument about how to do good. Murray&#39;s critics have,
inevitably, accused him of being stingy</p>

<p><a name="N15"></a> 15. This time the
writing that &quot;hovers&quot; over my thoughts is that by
Thomas Sowell. See most especially &quot;Knowledge and
Decisions&quot;, Basic Books, New York, 1980, for a
discussion of, for example, why getting rid of poverty is
harder than landing a man on the moon, an act that puzzles
many but ought not to. And see also, if you can get hold of
it, Sowell&#39;s &quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot;, my copy
of which has been terminally borrowed, for the contrast
between the &quot;constrained&quot; and the
&quot;unconstrained&quot; views of things. Believing that
problems are tough to solve and that therefore people
shouldn&#39;t necessarily feel too bad about failing to solve
them and should not routinely be denounced as evil, is my way
of endorsing the &quot;constrained&quot; vision. And if
everybody could only understand all this, what a wonderfully
improved world it would be! (&quot;Unconstrained&quot;!)</p>

<p>Also, before I&#39;d ever heard of Sowell,
I read Karl Popper, or those bits of him that I understood. I
recall his voice also, insisting that people are generally
well-meaning but often confused by the intractability of the
world and of society. Those wanting to hit that trail could
start by locking at two &quot;bluffer&#39;s guides&quot; on
Popper published by the Libertarian Alliance, John Gray&#39;s
&quot;The Liberalism of Karl Popper&quot;, Philosophical
Notes No. 9, 1988, and Kevin McFarlane&#39;s &quot;The
Critical Rationalism of Karl Popper, Philosophical Notes No.
16, 1990.</p>

<p><a name="N16"></a> 16. None of which means
that the usual answers I am generally faced with about how to
run libertarianism as a &quot;business&quot; are worth much.
Most such schemes consist only of the observation that
&quot;business&quot; always runs up huge printing bills for
glossy brochures whenever it does anything and therefore so
should the LA. See my &quot;Publishing Without
Perishing&quot;, Tactical Notes No. 9, Libertarian Alliance,
  London, 1990.
