title: I am a Libertarian Because

This piece began life as one page of a student
magazine called *Blueprint*, published by the
Conservatives of Exeter University in 1992. It
apparently caused a gratifying stir.

Does this kind of agitprop do any good? I like to
think that maybe it did. Perhaps most early
readers only noted the stir-causing bits and little
else, but I like to think that some of the more
thoughtful ones may have glanced through the rest
of it as well, and been stirred into thought as well
as politically correct outrage.

Also, there’s much to be said for soundbites, as
aphorisms are now disapprovingly dubbed by
those who disapprove of them.

The Internet (www.libertarian.co.uk gets you the
entire published output of the Libertarian
Alliance) makes this kind of excersise even more
useful, because the Internet makes it so much
easier for the thoughtul ones to dig deeper.

“Brenda”, by the way (see page 2), is the
nickname sometimes applied to Britain’s
“sovereign”, Queen Elizabeth II.

## I am a Libertarian because...

- Because wherever in the world something
    resembling libertarianism happens, life is
    good.
- Because wherever in the world the opposite
    of libertarianism happens, life is crap awful.
- Because letting other people take care of
    themselves means I don’t have to.
- Because me taking care of myself means
    other people don’t have to.
- Because, on the whole, people *are* free and it
    is accordingly more relaxing and more
    convenient to believe that they should be.
    Less needs to be changed.
- Because classical compact discs are
    wonderful.
- Because libertarianism frightens the horses.
- Because I honestly and truly don’t care what
    other people do to each other in bed, or in
    any places where I am not regularly present,
    provided only that they are happy. Not
    caring is the essence of charity. Most of the
    trouble in the world is caused by people
    trying to help.
- Because an armed society is a polite society.
- Because there isn’t enough sex and violence
    on television.
- Because selfish people are so much more
    pleasant to deal with. They tell you what
    they want. And they listen when you tell
    them what you want because what you want
    could make them rich.
- Because if hard drugs are as dangerous as
    people say, there is no better punishment for
    taking hard drugs than the consequence of
    taking hard drugs. Reality is, as always, its
    own reward and its own punishment.
- Because maybe hard drugs aren’t so bad for
    you after all! You decide. That way I don’t
    have to decide for you. (They terrify me and
    I want nothing to do with them, or the with
    the Drugs Squad).
- Because privately owned streets will be
    better policed, and in general, a vast
    improvement to the state of public morals.
- Because the Arts Council is to art what the
    Fire Brigade is to fire.
- Because my sovereign is me, not Brenda.
- Because I like writing about libertarianism.
- Because people like reading what I write
    about libertarianism.
- Because those who don’t like reading what I
    write about libertarianism shouldn’t have to
    read it.
- Because newspapers should be allowed to
    publish lies, filth, nonsense and tastelessness.
    Even *The Guardian* should be allowed.
- Because the people of Hong Kong should
    come and rescue the British economy.
- Because pollution is the result of things not
being sufficiently owned. Nobody owns the
ozone layer. The Adam Smith Institute
should cut it up and sell the bits.
- Because people should be allowed to be
racist bastards.
- Because if total state control is a mess, and a
“balance” between state control and liberty is
half reasonable, then total liberty would be
totally reasonable.
- Because tea granules are also wonderful.
- Because the people who run the European
Common Market are a gang of thieves.
Nobody needs to “harmonise” a market
except those who create that market by
harmonising things amongst themselves.
- Because life would be terminally boring if
the only things that were allowed were things
that I personally would allow.
- Because people should be allowed to choose
their own risks.
- Because people should be allowed to kill
themselves.
- Because a boss should be allowed to fire his
wage slave, without compensation, if he has
taken a dislike to the colour of her eyes.
- Because sexual harassment is in the eye of
the harassee.
- Because in a society without government
safeguards, reputation is everything.
- Because free people follow wise traditions,
and governments destroy wise traditions.
- Because the defence of capitalism cannot be
left to capitalists.
- Because being exploited is better than not
being exploited.
- Because students should pay their own damn
fees. Student loans already exist; they are
called overdrafts.
- Because I’m the Editorial Director of the
Libertarian Alliance, and stopping being a
libertarian would be inconvenient.
