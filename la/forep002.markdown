Defining words before using them is usually tiresome, but there are
some arguments where the meaning of a certain word is crucial to
the whole issue. Does “racialism” refer to belief about how races
differ, asks Roderick Moore in Political Notes 16 (*Facts, Values and Racialism*) or to beliefs about how they should be treated differently. (The first sort of belief, even if true, doesn’t excuse the
second.) John Scott Shea (in Political Notes 15) scrutinises the
word “Exploitation”.

So it is with the word “imperialism”, some of whose common
meanings are:

* Rule inflicted by foreigners.
* Wickedness inflicted by foreigners.
* Anything done by foreigners.
* Anything wicked, done by anyone anywhere.
* Belief in any of the above, acted upon or not.

The importance of the word “imperialism” in contemporary debate
is that it has established that rule by foreigners is by definition
wicked. Rule by foreigners is imperialism. Imperialism is wicked.
Q.E.D..

You might think that a libertarian would be the last to challenge
such thoughts. Libertarians dislike “rule” of any kind, certainly
state rule of the usual kind. Pay this, pay that, don’t do this, do do
that, and so on. A plague on it.

However, the mere nationality of the state’s functionaries has nothing to do with the libertarian case against the state. It is what they
do that is wrong, not who they are or how they were chosen. He
who taxes me may be Chinese. He may be “democratically
elected”. He may be “educated to rule” or even “born” to rule. He
may proclaim himself to be “God’s chosen one”. Irrelevant. It is
still wrong for him to take my wealth without my consent, using it
to forbid me from doing harmless things, and to force me to do
other things.

Thus, the question of whether it is better to be ruled by the IRA,
for instance, or by “British Imperialism”, is from the libertarian
point of view a matter of tactics. Neither arrangement is the libertarian utopia.

I can imagine several versions of British “home rule” that would
make me prefer other forms of rule administered from Brussels, or
Washington DC. An extreme left, Allende type British government
might well make me hope for foreign deliverance. So might a fascist government of the type that failed leftist regimes often leave in
their wake.

I’m told that many Puerto Ricans now want their island to become
a permanent part of the United States, and be a state like Florida or
Texas. If that happened it would certainly be called “imperialism”.
But would it be bad for Puerto Rico? According to many Puerto
Ricans, no.

Suppose a clique of Cuban tradesmen had fixed thirty years ago for
Cuba to become part of the USA, as did happen for Hawaii eighty
years ago. Might not the Cubans have been better off?
By a fluke of imperial collision, Hong Kong has been ruled by a
group of expatriate British. By far the most serious complaint
about this system is that it will probably soon end.

## ENSLAVING THEMSELVES?

> A commercial company enslaves a nation comprising two hundred millions. Tell this to a man free from superstition and he
will fail to grasp what those words mean. What does it mean
that thirty thousand men ... have subdued two hundred million?
Do not the figures make clear that it is not the English who
have enslaved the Indians, but the Indians who have enslaved
themselves?

Wendy McElroy quotes the above words by Leo Tolstoy at the end
of her Voluntaryist Series Pamphlet No. III, called “Demystitying
the State”, and ends her pamphlet thus:

> People today enslave themselves when all that freedom requires is the word: “No”.

But suppose these millions had said “No” (to the British East India
Company). Would that automatically have guaranteed “freedom”?
Might not more vexatious, locally staffed political institutions have
resulted? Presumably many Indians thought so.

Local rulers know about their locality and may maybe — govern it
in a way better suited to local wishes than any ignorant foreigners
could contrive.

But what if local rulers use their expert local knowledge to oppress
the people more skillfully than any ignorant foreigners could contrive? As American libertarians like to say: if you thought taxation
without representation was bad, try the other kind.
Consider tribally divided societies. Maybe a gang of foreign invaders just means more misery. But maybe the overwhelmingly
superior foreigners can suppress otherwise endless tribal squabbles
with bland impartiality. The local ex-chiefs may get angry, but
might not the people be more content?
“Imperialism” won’t definitely be better, but it might be.
Furthermore, it might make rather an attractive service industry.

## THERE ALREADY IS A MARKET IN GOVERNMENT

Some Libertarian Alliance subscribers want a “limited state” not
unlike Hong Kong. Others — including me — go further, and
seek a market in “government” itself. Free market police forces.
Free market law courts. Free market “defence”.

But how are those of us wanting this “anarcho-capitalist” world to
get it? It seems to me that there are two ways to look at the existing governmental arrangements of the planet with a view to improving them in a libertarian direction: the protesting, moralistic
way; and the way that might work.

Moralistic protest is Ms. McElroy’s strong suit. “Does any individual” she asks “have the right to initiate force?”
Insofar as people actually do “mystify” the state in their own
minds, such questions are valuable. But underneath the pieties
most adults take a more practical view. Whether or not the personel of governments have the “right” to initiate force, the fact is
that they do, and so do lots of other people. The best most people
can hope for is to have a less rather than more rapacious, more
rather than less “protective” government.

The simplest way to get a less bad government is to move to an
area where they have a less bad government. A campaign to
achieve major improvements (culminating perhaps in outright
abolition) of one’s own government can only be economically rational if combined with other more achievable aims, such as trying
to make one’s name as a writer.

But what sort of campaign ought it to be? We anarcho-capitalists
want a world that has “protection agencies” instead of “governments”. “Government” would become a service industry, with
costs, customers, production problems, advertising, battles (how
ferocious?) for market share, and so on. But there are ways and
ways of getting to such a world.

Why not also agitate for a succession of governmental changes that
would make governments themselves steadily more like “protection
agencies”, so that in due course they would truly become that?

The libertarian “protesting moralist” demands the abolition of immigration controls. But what if governments were to sell citizenship, and use the proceeds to lower the tax burden (thus making
the product more attractive, thus boosting revenue, thus lowering
taxation yet again)? This would be “gradualism”, and there’s certainly no point in concentrating only on that one scheme, but such
a change might at least cut through the ferocious absolutes that
now rage in arguments about immmigration controls. Think of the
indirect benefits that might begin to occur. If the entry fee was
impressive enough, governments would advertise for more immigrants, and the publicity department would, like all publicity departments, nag the production people (the government) to make the
promises be true ones (“govern” well).

Britain’s local “authorities” already advertise for people and businesses to come and live and trade in their territories, and the
various states compete even more fiercely in the USA, to the great
benefit of the “consumers”. People have been able to vote with
their feet for lower taxes. The “advertisers” of high tax states said
that cheap government would mean shoddy government. The
"market" in state government has proved them wrong. (For the
details of this story see *The Economy in Mind* by Warren Brookes.)
The more people come to think in these “market in government”
terms, the less need there’ll be for all the inverted commas.

## FREE MARKET “IMPERIALISM”

And what of the brand new protection agencies for which libertarians agitate? Seeing government as already being a market will
push libertarian protection agency entrepreneurs towards gaps in
the market rather than towards head on collisions with established
businesses.

The market in preventing civil war in the Western democracies is
sewn up, at the moment. (See my *Liberty Versus Democracy*, Political Notes 5, which deals with the civil war preventing function
of democracy.) Those libertarians who allow their opinions (many
do) to read like recommendations for free enterprise civil war between provinces of hitherto peaceful countries, fought by “private
armies”, will get few customers even for their opinions.

Preventing civil war in tribally divided societies is, on the other
hand, being done less well, mostly because of obsessive belief in
the intrinsic virtues of democracy. There’s a definite market gap
here.

The trick might be for the civil war prevention traders to start
cranking out verdicts, together with the necessary threats to make
the verdicts stick. Easier said than done, I agree, but most would-be “world statesmen” never even say such things. Say: this is our
verdict, for which we will push, despite the fact that it is “imperialism” and that we have “no right” to behave in this arrogant way.
And say: only the unanimous verdict of the locals will change our
minds. (This technique is the origin of the jury system. The king
didn’t want to defy a united local public opinion, and juries ensured that he never did.)

How might all this be paid for? Stick the process on world-wide
television, and administer it not as a “smoke-filled-room” operation, but as a televised free market court of law.

The role of “electronic imperialism” is very important here. Already, without anyone trying to do much besides make lots of
money, the new communications technology is making nonsense of
national boundaries. By settling about seven civil wars at once,
dotted all over the globe, our sellers of tribal harmony could put on
a really good television show for a global and hence very lucrative
audience.

Peace making of this kind could all too easily start wars rather than
stop them, and be a menace generally. Such power is dangerous.
All the more reason to make the process public.

## SELLING LAW AND ORDER

At the more local level, there’s a “law and order” problem in many
of the Third World “banana republics”, and in the centres of large
cities, especially in the USA if Charles Bronson movies are anything to go by. There’s a market gap in the business of curbing
muggers, rapists, urban and rural terrorists and so on. Again, pay
for it by sticking the thing on television. Why have actors playing
Cops and Robbers? Use the real thing. Cameras are already used
for surveillance and to provide evidence.

Once successful protection agencies are in business, they can extract payment from local property owners by threatening to switch
off the service. Or, the protection agency could invest in land in
the places it intends to pacify.

## SELLING “WORLD PEACE”

The biggest gap of all in the protection market is at the global
level, where the same states that stop internal battles now threaten
to blow each other and everyone else to nuclear smithereens.
The problem is to intimidate the rulers of the nuclear superpowers
into being nice to one another, and I agree, that’s quite a problem.
It would require big changes in the Communist world, or the "free"
world, or both, before the world’s many leaders ever get round that
table everyone talks about.

The “peace movement” has made a not wholly contemptible effort
to get into this business, but their publicity department, which asserts most persuasively that “peace” would indeed be very nice,
has run ahead of the production side. There is more to peacemaking that waving banners, and if the “peace movement” people did
make any “peace”, what sort would it be?

I believe that the kind of electronic imperialism described above
will best tackle this problem. Anarcho-capitalism, far from being a
starry eyed impossibility, is for this particular purpose the ideal
mental equipment. There’s no point in arguing for a “world government” (complete with unstageable elections, an impossible to
agree “world constitution”, and so forth). This would fail for the
same reason that the United Nations already has failed. Because
the search for “world peace” is defined as an intrinsically political
task, no progress has been made. Expecting the United Nations to
solve the “world peace” problem is like expecting a bunch of gangland lawyers to solve the problem of organised crime.

A libertarian approach to nuclear disarmament might be to say:
What offers might a tradesman make to the politicians that they
couldn’t refuse? What would that cost? Who would gain from it,
and hence who might be persuaded to pay for it? I’d say that since
“world peace” will benefit lots of people a bit, but very few very
much, and certainly not the existing rich, the search for it should
— economically speaking — be an exercise in show business.
This trade also pays for itself by getting numerous small amounts
of cash from many people, mostly of quite slender means.

Libertarian discussion concerning “peace” tends to be too sentimental. Some libertarians suppose that if only “the world became
libertarian” all would be well, when in fact libertarianism (like socialism) might merely become the new language of human antagonism, local, national and global. Sometimes peace just happens.
But often peace is either made or absent, like shoes or combine
harvesters. It is seldom the mere consequence of shared philosophical assumptions.

Which is not to say that my entrepreneurial hunches about how to
make peace — for that is all they are — are necessarily wise ones.
Many libertarians will say that the “services” I’ve been describing
would be an anti-libertarian monstrosity.
